The '''Nazi Lowriders''' are a [[criminal syndicate]] and a '''Lowrider Car Club''' that are based in [[Southern California]] and are active only in [[Southern California]]. '''Nazi Lowriders''' are also known collectively as '''The NLR''' and are also collectively known as '''The Ride''' of '''Nazi Lowriders'''.

==This Digital Article==
The '''Nazi Lowriders''' also known as The '''Nazi Lowrider Car Club''' are a defunct car club that no longer operates. There are no members of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club as of the year 2016 and the founders are dead. There were never any Italian members or Latin American members of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club. This digital article is set to correct the errors on the Internet about the '''Nazi Lowrider Car Club'''.

==Origins of The Nazi Lowriders==
The '''Nazi Lowriders''' were formed in [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] and in [[Los Angeles County]], [[Southern California]] in the late [[1960s]] as a gang of members who owned [[Chevrolet]] [[Lowrider]] '''Vehicles''' that had origins in the Southern California [[Lowrider]] [[Car Culture]] Community. Supposedly, they were first documented by U.S. Law Enforcement authorities on the border of [[East Los Angeles]], [[Southern California]] and in [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] in the mid [[1970s]] and later.

The name of this lowrider gang was originally a play on words on rival [[Hispanic]] Car Club names as being the most '''Racially Pure''' out of all of the '''Hispanic Car Clubs''' in '''Southern California''' as the gang fought their enemy '''Hispanic Lowrider Gangs''' and overcame their rival '''Hispanic Lowrider Gangs''' in Southern California. The [[Law of the United States|U.S. Legal System]] that was constructed and formed in Southern California throughout the [[1950s]] by invading [[Non-Hispanic White]] [[Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States|Population Groups]] into Southern California favored the racially pure over all other ethnic groups. The Nazi Lowriders did not start as a [[Neo-Nazi]] Gang, they started as a Hispanic Lowrider Car Club and the founder is / was known to be part Hispanic.

Nazi Lowriders formed their own [[Prison Gang]] in Southern California in the late [[1970s]] as they were incarcerated for street crimes in Southern California and they later in [[1997]] formed a small temporary alliance with the original members of the [[Aryan Brotherhood]] of [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] after the 11 year old biological son of the founders of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club spoke to a high ranking boss of the [[Sinaloa Cartel]] in [[Los Angeles County]], [[Southern California]] and later as a 13 year old he spoke to a Captain of the [[Hells Angels|Hell's Angels Motorcycle Club]] as the '''Nazi Lowriders''' gained more membership, but not from the '''Hell's Angels Motorcycle Club''' membership base and not from the '''Aryan Brotherhood''' membership base. It was later revealed that the [[U.S. Navy]] was surveilling that [[Sinaloa Cartel]] Boss' residence in [[Los Angeles]], [[Los Angeles County]], [[Southern California]] before and after these visits and discussions. When he was 15 years old he spoke to a Lieutenant and a General of the '''Hell's Angels''' Motorcycle Club of [[Bakersfield]], [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] and of [[Long Beach]], [[Los Angeles County]], [[Southern California]] who offered him membership, but he has clearly stated that he declined membership in the '''Hell's Angels Motorcycle Club'''.

The '''Hell's Angels''' of Southern California had discussed either buying the name of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club or temporarily change alliances for the sake of several small towns in [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] and Northern [[Los Angeles County]], [[Southern California]] lived in by allied gangs.

The son of the founder of the Nazi Lowriders decided to temporarily add alliances to the Nazi Lowrider Car Club for the fate of several small towns in [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] where enemy groups wanted to sell off pieces of [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] to the enemies of Southern California who were not from California at all or might have been from Northern California. The founder of the Nazi Lowriders Car Club and his biological son have admitted to being anti-Slavic, anti-Italian, anti-Irish, anti-Russian and against the immigration of several different ethnic population groups into Southern California namely from Southern Non-Hispanic White population groups because the Nazi Lowriders technically are part [[Hispanic]] and because the Nazi Lowriders are descended multi-generationally from California. He cited the partial Mexican-Hispanic ethnicity of [[Edward Furlong]]. Instead he decided to form a temporary alliance with the existing population groups in [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] having already been a longtime ally of several different [[Chicano]] and [[Chicana]] Car Clubs in [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] as well as of the [[Chicanos]] of [[Lamont]], [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]].

The '''Nazi Lowrider''' [[Car Club]] and the '''Nazi Lowrider''' [[Prison Gang]] are the same and these entities were not founded by [[John Stinson]] or by the [[Aryan Brotherhood]] and in fact the '''Nazi Lowriders''' existed in Southern California long before the founding of the '''Aryan Brotherhood''' in [[Southern California]]. Originally, the Nazi Lowriders were formed as a White-Hispanic Car Club of Southern California in the late [[1960s]], the [[1970s]], the [[1980s]] and the [[1990s]]. The phrase '''White-Hispanic''' used here is a play on words on the gangland phrases of '''Hispanic''' where the phrase actually means to be the most racially pure out of everyone. The Nazi Lowriders literally found parent-to-parent descent from a King of Spain.

Collected verifiable media and verifiable video footage in [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] and in [[Los Angeles County]], [[Southern California]] namely from [[Lowrider Magazine]] of Southern California as well as from video news reports from [[KTLA|Video News Reporting Agencies]] in '''Los Angeles, Los Angeles County, Southern California''' and Video News Agencies in [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] show the '''Nazi Lowriders''' in '''street races''' near [[Boyle Heights]] in [[East Los Angeles]], [[Southern California]] in the early [[1990s]] as well as in Super Sport '''Lowrider Car Shows''' in [[Central Los Angeles]], [[Southern California]] and near [[West Los Angeles]], [[Southern California]] and in gun fights all around [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] in the mid [[1990s]] to the mid [[2000s]].

===Classification of The Nazi Lowrider Car Club===
* The Nazi Lowrider Car Club were classified as a Lowrider Car Club and a small cartel by Southern California State Authorities in the ~1990s.
* '''Georgia Hiawatha Jennings''' who is the grandmother of a founding member of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club is a Oklahoma Dust Bowl migrant from Oklahoma State / Oklahoma Territory / Indian Territory with partial American Indian Ancestry from Oklahoma that first lived in the [[Lamont]], [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] dust bowl migrant camps and later in the [[Arvin]], [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] dust bowl migrant camps before getting a start in Southern California in the [[1940s]]. She was later featured in 1 Hollywood Film titled: '''Better In Black''' and may have been an extra in the ~1966 film '''Hell's Angels On Wheels''' at the filming location at '''Hart Park''' in '''East Bakersfield''', '''Kern County''', '''Southern California'''. '''Jack Nicholson''' made an official comment on video about '''Georgia Hiawatha Jennings''' from his mansion stating that he '''"Did not remember seeing her on the set of Hell's Angels On Wheels, but that she may have been recorded on video in the original cut of the film at the filming location at Hart Park.'''"
* The founding member of the '''Nazi Lowrider Car Club''' was known to drive a '''Green Chevy Impala Lowrider Vehicle'''. His biological son later tracked down this '''Green Chevy Impala Lowrider Vehicle''' in ~2012 and found that if it is the same vehicle it was put in impound and sold to a Jewish Company. The vehicle was visibly splashed with an acid that can melt down metals somewhere in [[Los Angeles]], [[Los Angeles County]], [[Southern California]] or in [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]]. The founding member of the '''Nazi Lowrider Car Club''' died in ~1995 in [[Los Angeles]], [[Los Angeles County]], [[Southern California]] after getting into a gun fight with rival / enemy drug cartel members close to [[West Los Angeles]], [[Los Angeles County]], [[Southern California]].

===What Is a Real Hispanic and What Is a Fake Hispanic ?===
The word '''Hispanic''' literally refers to all of the people who are members of the world of '''Hispania'''. The word '''Hispania''' literally refers to the entire world of people who speak the language of Spanish and who also have some form of ancestry from the country of Spain in Europe. 90%+ of the entire population of humans that are within the world of Spanish speakers are not actually Hispanic and they are not actually members of the world of Hispania because to be Hispanic is to actually have ancestry from the country of Spain in Europe in some form.

IF: anyone who speaks the language of Spanish or any dialect of the language of Spanish and who does not actually have verifiable ancestry by parent-to-parent from the country of Spain in Europe from parent-to-parent then they are not actually Hispanic and they are not actually members of the world of Hispania because the language of Spanish is from the country of Spain in Europe. This includes all of the countries that are within the Americas: 90%+ of all population groups who speak the language of Spanish within North-America, Mexico, Central-America and South-America are not actually Hispanic, instead they are only Indigenous American Indians and they are technically only Indigenous American Indians of the areas that they are from. Technically most of the popuation groups of Mexico and every country that is below the country of Mexico are of Indigenous American Indian descent, but if they do not actually have ancestry from Spain that is proveable by parent-to-parent then they are not actually Hispanic. Nazi Lowriders have a few verifiable ancestral roots from the Royal Spanish Bourbons from parent-to-parent. Some Nazi Lowriders are directly descended from Michel / Michael Antoine Garoutte who was a colonial founder of the U.S. Navy which is an entire branch of the U.S. Armed Forces and Michel / Michael Antoine Garoutte's biological grandfather was the King of Spain. Some are also directly descended from the King of Denmark and Norway, Christian VIII and the King of Denmark, Federick VII.

===What Is The Difference Between a Biological Father, Step-Father, Foster-Father and a Father In Gangland ?===
In gangland a Biological Father is the father that impregnates the Biological Mother and has a child. A Step-Father is a man that functions as a biological father to the child, but is not a biological father to the child. A Foster-Father is a man
that adopts the child as his own child, but is not a biological father to the child. A father in gangland is a man who is among the leadership of a gang.

===What Is a Latino / Latina Otherwise Known As a Latin American ?===
The word Latino is the word that is used to refer to a male person with ancestry from Latin America. The word Latina is the word that is used to refer to a female person with ancestry from Latin America. The phrase Latin America is a phrase that is used to refer to all of the countries that are within the Americas and that are below the country of México. 90%+ of every population group that are within the countries of Latin America and who are from the countries of Latin America have negroid ancestry. Negroid ancestry means to be descended from a Negroid black human person from the country of Africa or elsewhere. Anyone with Latin American ancestry or Negroid ancestry is not allowed affiliation with the Nazi Lowrider Car Club, their members or their member's families and they are not allowed affiliation with or membership in the Nazi Lowrider Car Club.

===Number of Official Members of The Nazi Lowrider Car Club===
By 1993 and 1994 Southern California Law Enfocement had documented 23 - 28 known and official members of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club in [[Los Angeles]], [[Los Angeles County]], [[Southern California]]. From 1999 to 2008 law enforcement evaluated the number of members of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club that were incarcerated in Southern California Prisons as more members were recruited by senior membership. It is currently unknown how many members there are of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club, but the California Gang Task Forces from the [[1990s]] provided an unofficial estimate of membership in the year 2009 and this estimate by the California Gang Task Forces does not mean that they are correct about the number of members of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club because the California Gang Task Forces were removed from law enforcement in the late [[1990s]]. The Nazi Lowriders do not have 1,000 members as of the year 2025. Collectively out of the entire list of alliances the Nazi Lowriders had in the 1990s in Southern California combining together alliances with The Las Cruces Lowrider Car Club of Las Cruces, Doña Ana County, Southern New Mexico; The Chicano / Chicana Car Club of Lamont, Kern County, Southern California ( Who are tied in with the Chicano Movement from the 1960s ); The Surens of Lamont, Kern County, Southern California ( This is the only real Sinaloa Cartel and the real Mexican Mafia of Southern California ); The Tsalagi American Indian Nation ( of Kern County, Southern California ); The Tejon Indian Tribe ( of Kern County, Southern California ); The Santa Clarita Drug Cartel ( of Santa Clarita, Los Angeles County ( Formerly Kern County ), Southern California ); The "Pismoso" Drug Cartel ( of Pismo, San Luis Obispo County, Southern California ); The Santa Monica Italian Mafia ( of Santa Monica, Los Angeles County, Southern California ); The Hell's Angels Satellite Clubs ( of Long Beach, Los Angeles County, Southern California and of Bakersfield, Kern County, Southern California ); The original Lowrider Car Clubs of Kern County, Southern California who are in the official Nazi Lowrider Alliance list of the 1990s; The Oklahoma Car Club of Kern County, Southern California ( The ones who own all old fashion 1930s-1950s Chevrolet Cars and who are descended from the Dust Bowl of Oklahoma State of the 1930s ); The AB of Kern County, Southern California;  there are / were approximately ~1,000 people. This is the de-facto super Cartel of Southern California.

==History of The Development of California As a Statehood==
Southern California did not actually begin development of its cities until the 1950s. In the 1930s Los Angeles was a small city and every area within Los Angeles was its own Census Designated Place including the area of what is now known as Santa Monica which was not actually part of Los Angeles City or Los Angeles County. Southern California city development and the entire California State development of roads, highways, rail, cities and everything else in it is only at the most approximately 75 years old as of the year 2025. Much of the officially purported histories in Southern California are partially or completely false. Before 1940 75% of the Californian population was Spanish speaking and it was fought over by Northern Mexicans and existing Californians. Northern Mexicans and Eurpoean Spanish actually wiped out the majority of the American Indian Nations living within California who had no European Spanish ancestry by the late 19th Century. Los Angeles County, Ventura County and Kern County were the biggest human settlements in Southern California because of the capability of farmland. Most of the areas of Kern County extending out to what is now known at the Grapevine was actually wetlands and swamplands. Wetlands and swamplands when drained of water make for excellent farming land. It was almost impossible for anyone to have transported goods or crops through the mountains from [[Kern County]] to [[Los Angeles County]] or from [[Los Angeles County]] to [[Kern County]] from the 1940s to the 1970s.

This proves that there was no Italian American presence in Southern California and no Italian American ownership in Southern California until after the late 1960s and nearly the entire political backstory behind the name Joseph DiGiorgio in Kern County is completely false. The European Spanish Empire in California sided with the existing Mexicans and the existing Californians in war against the expanding U.S. population groups into California and the European Spanish Empire in America was always at war with the Northern French and the Italians all over the world. The Lake Isabella Dam which stopped and controlled the flow of water and river water in to lower elevation in Kern County was not actually completed until the late 1960s and most U.S. Military bases in California began construction in the mid to late 1940s. This previously stated fact completely disproves any advanced farmland capability in Kern County before the 1970s which also completely proves that the entire backstory behind Joseph DiGiorgio in Kern County is fake.

The entire United States population from the 1770s to the 1970s despised Italian people, Irish people, Slavic people, Russian people and other Non-Hispanic White ethnic groups that did not descent from Western Germany, England, Northern France and other places. Most also despised Gaelic groups such as the Irish and the Scottish because of English propaganda. They also hated all African descended groups and all Hispanic groups who were not actually of White Hispanic descent from European Spain. The U.S. Federal Government regularly handed out propaganda in Non-Hispanic White communities that advertized hate against Italian people, Irish people, Slavic people and Russian people during and before the cold war from the 1940s to the 1990s. California is a very new U.S. State regardless of whatever phony history and phony documentation that the U.S. Government fabricates about it. California was not a U.S. State in 1880 and it was not a U.S. State in 1930. To prove this one only needs to research to see when the first U.S. Military bases were installed in Southern California which were in the years of approximately ~1940 and after.

===Short History of The Migrants of The Oklahoma Dust Bowl===
Because the '''Dust Bowl''' only affected certain areas of the areas now known as [[Oklahoma]] within the [[United States]] and because it did not affect any other areas in the U.S.. The remains, including the remaining destroyed buildings and houses of the areas in [[Oklahoma]] that were affected by the [[Dust Bowl]] can still be seen today as of the year 2025. These areas are hard to travel to and one cannot travel there by vehicle, train or airplane. The entire area was sealed off to the public in 1950 after the dust storms in Oklahoma partially settled and they sent scouts to these areas and found hundreds if not thousands of decaying human corpses who died there due to suffocation and starvation as well as the inability to drive anywhere or walk anywhere to get food or resources. Food cannot be grown in continous dust storms that engulf the land. The Dust Bowl was a non-stop dust storm in several areas in Oklahoma for almost ~15 years. Food and products could not be logistically transported or moved into the areas that were affected by the non-stop dust bowl storms therefore no one in these areas could eat or drink anything and they died fast from starvation and from dust storm suffocation. No one that left went back to help anyone that couldn't leave. Most of the dead in the [[Dust Bowl]] were not even buried and they died between the year 1930 and 1938 having died within 7-25 days of starvation and suffocation.. the dead were left in their houses or outside and were found decaying from the years of 1934 to 1950. The people who made it out of the '''Dust Bowl of Oklahoma''' are considered very fortunate to have done so. The officially purported histories on the Dust Bowl of Oklahoma are completely false and censored as the U.S. Government continues to create phony documentation to support their claims of when cities were incorporated, when U.S. States achieved ratification and more. Following the example of the U.S. State of Arizona: There was no U.S. State of Arizona and it wasn't called Arizona. Arizona acquired most of it's land from New Mexico after 1950 and most of the areas within the borders of what is now known as Arizona were ceded from New Mexico after 1970. The film '''The Grapes of Wrath''' is a censored and childish version of the real events. Most of the areas that are now within the borders of what is known as Oklahoma State is swampland. There are still dust storms in these areas in Oklahoma State today as of the year 2025. The dust storms are an earthly cycle whereas the '''Dust Bowl''' of Oklahoma killed a lot of people. The affected were forced to leave or die there and most died in the storms because they couldn't go anywhere, they couldn't eat any food and they could drink any water. There were no stores in any of the areas. There were no roads to drive on and most of the people did not even own a vehicle. The first widely used and commercially available vehicle was the T-Model and the vehicles could not be purchased by most people. The people that made it out of the '''Dust Bowl of Oklahoma''' had to travel in groups North-East first and then most of them waited, starved and piled into 1 small T-Model vehicle. The U.S. rail system didn't even have a railraod setup to deliver goods and products in the area. The closest developed areas were East to Missouri and took 2 months of walking to get there.

====Oklahoma Dust Bowl Migrant Fraud====
The Internet lies about the number Migrants of the Oklahoma Dust Bowl as well as what areas were actually affected by the Dust Bowl. In the 1920s, 1930s and the 1940s California had ennacted laws that prevented the migration and settling of California and restricted legal California residency to the communities that long lived in California. California was considered a paradise area and was highly sought after by people
who were from outside of California. All of the sources that are findable on the Internet about the Oklahoma Dust Bowl are completely false and the claims are also completely false. There is a claim on the Internet that up to 2.5 million people were affected by the Oklahoma Dust Bowl and migrated west, but this statement is completely false. There were not even 2.5 million people living within the Western United States during these times. The current approximate population of the United States is ~200 - ~300 million people as of the year 2025 and about 30% of that population group are first generation, second generation or third generation immigrants from other countries. It's impossible for there to be more than 4 generations living at any given time in any given decade because the longest a human being can live is ~122 years whereas a sizeable percentage of the population as a whole lives to ~77 years old and dies. The people that settled the Oklahoma Territory either fought in wars for the U.S. President from approximately ~1850 to 1900 or they acquired their land claims from origins within Missouri. The total number of people that applied for land claims in the Oklahoma Land Rush combined with the previous land rushes were about ~8,000 to ~20,000 people, but not everyone was permitted land from the claims. The number of people that enlisted and fought in the wars for U.S. President Andrew Jackson were about ~8,000. Only the people that fought in the wars for U.S. President Andrew Jackson as well as the existing American Indian Nations that fought for U.S. President Andrew Jackson could claim land in Oklahoma Territory from 1880 to 1900. This only leaves 1 - 2 generations from these land settlements and a human woman is only capable of creating a new human being for up to a maximum of 11 months out of 1 year. Do the math. It's impossible. It's impossible that there were more than ~80,000 people living in the Oklahoma Territory from 1880 to 1930 and since 1 woman can only create 1 new human being at the most 1 time in 14 months then it's impssible that there were 2.5 million Oklahoma Dust Bowl Migrants, and these dust bowls only affected and killed people in these areas in Oklahoma and not anywhere else. World War 1 began ultimately in 1907 and officially ended in public consensus in approximately ~1918, but it never actually ended and it carried into World War 2. Several thousands of people that escaped the Oklahoma Dust Bowl did migrate to California where they were met with forced concentration camps with different people from Mexico, forced labor camps with people from Mexico and other kinds of camps before they were vetted. The only way to know how many migrants there were of the Oklahoma Dust Bowl that made it to California is to count the numbers of people there were in the concentration camps and in the labor camps in Kern County from 1928 to 1941.

===History of The Waves of Immigration Into California and The Formation of California Street Gangs===
[[Non-Hispanic White]] [[street gangs]] and [[African-American]] [[street gangs]] did not actually exist in Southern California before the arrival of Non-Hispanic Whites or during the arrival of Non-Hispanic Whites and [[African-Americans]] into [[Southern California]] as well as during and before the waves of immigration of Non-Hispanic Whites into [[Southern California]] from the [[1920s]] to the [[1960s]]. Supposedly most of the palm trees that are now in Southern California were actually imported from Arab countries during the Arab cultural craze in Southern California of the 1920s and the 1930s.

The town of [[Compton]], in [[Southern California]] was originally a Non-Hispanic White neighborhood from the [[1940s]] to the late [[1960s]] before it became incorporated into the [[County of Los Angeles]] afterwhich a wave of [[African-Americans]] moved into the houses in [[Compton]], [[Southern California]] and slowly overtook the area and were visibly seen as a street gang known as the '''Cripps''' which is a word that is usually shortened to [[Crips]], where then after the formation of the '''Cripps''': the '''Bloods''' then began as a new branch of the '''Cripps''' that also visibly showed a force in these areas throughout the 1980s. During the immigration of [[African-Americans]] into [[Compton]], [[Southern California]] they were segregated to their own side of this town that were collectively called '''The Pits''' and '''The Slums''' of '''Compton''' until they overtook the entire town to the border of the city of [[South Gate]], [[Southern California]] throughout the [[1980s]] and into the [[1990s]]. Primary immigration of the [[African-American]] population groups into these areas in [[Southern California]] come from the U.S. State of [[Louisiana]] from the [[1970s]] to the [[1990s]].

The '''Bloods''' were originally a cultural part of the '''Cripps''', but essentially the '''Bloods''' gangs are the same thing as the '''Cripps''' gangs. The '''Cripps''' were slowly forced to move away from [[Compton]], [[Los Angeles]] in [[Southern California]] throughout the late [[1990s]] to the early to mid [[2000s]] while they were at occupational war with invading enemy Hispanic gangs. The '''Cripps''' gang were founded by [[Hispanics]] before they began recruiting African-Americans in the [[1970s]]. In the late [[1990s]] it was revealed to the rest of the Los Angeles [[gangland]] community that the '''Cripps''' were in fact formed by Hispanics while they used African-American gang members as a visible and showable force.

The primary waves of immigration of Non-Hispanic Whites into [[Southern California]] began after the [[1930s]] and included numerous waves of immigration of Non-Hispanic Whites from the Southern-Central United States namely from [[Oklahoma]] and the affected areas of the [[Dust Bowl]]. The recently added histories to the [[Dust Bowl]] are completely false. The [[Dust Bowl]] only affected Oklahoma and there were several years of unending dust storms that happened all year around. Absolutely no crops could be grown, all of the houses were destroyed and the dust suffocated the entire population. Most residents had to evacuate the areas in Oklahoma that were affected by the dust bowl. People starved to death because they couldn't go anywhere. The Dust Bowl completely stopped all commerce in these areas in Oklahoma from the 1930s to the mid 1940s. The Dust Bowl did not affect any other states or any other neighboring states except for Oklahoma.

California State Law was previously ennacted from the [[1930s]] to the [[1950s]] to illegalize the immigration of any '''Americans''' from other U.S. States into California and [[Spanish California]] did not actually end socially after the early [[1900s]]. Every U.S. State west of the [[New England]] Colony States in the U.S. became a recognized and ratified U.S. State after the early to mid [[1900s]]. [[Oklahoma]] State for instance was not actually a recognized and ratified U.S. State until after [[1920]] because it was still called [[Indian Territory]] while the U.S. maintained efforts of colonizing [[Indian Territory]] and everything west of [[Indian Territory]] by [[White]] [[Settlers]].

The U.S. [[Social Security Number]] was not introduced to [[U.S. Citizens]] until the mid [[1930s]], the U.S. Social Security Program was not widely forced into the U.S. population until the 1940s and the U.S. Social Security Number was not enforced on U.S. Citizens until after the 1950s. The [[Dust Bowl]] of the areas of [[Oklahoma]] brought waves of surviving [[American Indians]] as well as [[Non-Hispanic Whites]] from the areas known as [[Indian Territory]] into [[Southern California]] beginning in the mid [[1930s]]. While the U.S. encouraged expansion of and settling in and further west of [[Indian Territory]] most of California safeguarded its territorial borders and restricted immigration from other U.S. territories.

The dominating social force in '''California''' was known as the '''Californias''' and [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]] during these years were still lived in primarily by Southern-Western American Indian Tribes that traveled around in small bands. Most American Indians of what is now known as the South-West United States moved away to areas in México after battling with the U.S. Military Forces in the early [[1900s]] and before regaining their land and establishing treaties with the U.S. Government throughout the [[1970s]]. The American Indian Movement which is usually shortened to AIM was a movement in Arizona and in New Mexico by Sou;th Western American Indians that reclaimed American Indian Land throughout the 1970s and established new treaties with the U.S. Government where the U.S. Government recognized them federally.

[[Italians]] and [[Italian-Americans]] did not actually begin waves of immigration into California until after the [[1950s]] and the migration of the affected of the [[Dust Bowl]] did not have any Italian population groups because the U.S. government did not allow Italians or Italian-Americans to claim any land in the [[Oklahoma Land Rush]] or in any [[Indian Territory]] because none of them actually lived in the U.S. and none of them fought in any of the wars for U.S. President [[Andrew Jackson]], and war participation was required in order to apply for and secure land ownership in Indian Territory by those White European Settlers under the Indian Territory Land Claims Acts / Land Rushes known as the [[Sooner Land Rush]] and the [[Oklahoma Land Rush]].

In military terminology [[Occupation]] refers to [[agenda|agendized]] groups of people who literally move into the houses in the area of their enemies or else into the area of their enemies in order to take over the area while they go to war with the local population groups, kill them off and then move more allies into that area in order to own that area in every way possible.

The primary waves of concentrated illegal immigration of Non-Latino Slav ( [[Slavic]] ), ( [[Russians]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Eastern Europeans]] ) and Latino-Slav as well as [[Armenians]] into California did not actually begin until the early to mid [[2000s]] as they began colonizing areas in [[Central America]] and [[South America]] and began traveling north to the borders of the U.S. and México to then illegally enter into Southern California.

The original [[Californians]] were known as the [[Californianos]] and the [[Californianas]] who had multi-generational ancestral descent from the Spanish Empire in the [[Californias]].

The original American Indians in the areas that are now known as California were the American Indigenous People who lived all throughout the easily accessible areas of what is now known as California because they did not have access to horses or carriages and no roads existed in California for them travel long distance. They were mostly concentrated along the coastal areas of California where there were easily accessible fishing. Horses were not actually brought into the Pacific Americas en mass until after the 18th century where they then bred Spanish horses and ponies in California.

Waves of immigration of [[Central Americans]] and [[South Americans]] into [[California]] did not actually begin until after the [[1960s]], but some of these population groups existed in California in small numbers. While [[Latinos]] and [[Latinas]] can claim American Indigenous heritage because they descend ancestrally from Indigenous groups of [[Central America]] and [[South America]] they cannot claim to have been in [[California]] before the [[1850s]] or before the [[1950s]] because there were no means to transport them in large groups even by Spanish ships that sailed the Pacific Coastlines. Since they cannot validly claim to have been in [[California]] before the [[1850s]] or before the [[1950s]] they cannot validly claim California as their land. The Latinos and the Latinas of Central-America and South-America did not fight in any of the wars for California and they did not fight in any of the wars on the side of the existing American Indian Tribes within what is now known as the South-Western United States or any other places within the areas that are now known as the United States. This means that Latinos and Latinas can only claim the lands of Central-American and South-America.

Instead, the Spanish put to work in California the Indigenous of the areas of what is now known as Northern México to the border of California State and of the areas of what is now known as California State. The Chicanos and the Chicanas however did exist in California during these decades because they are of descent from the areas that are now known as California as well as from the areas that are now known as Northern Mexico, but these people do not really have any recent generation Latino or Latina heritage. The Latinos and the Latinas of Central-America and of South-America could not have migrated to the areas of California in large groups before the 1940s. It's impossible. There were no developed roads to drive on to California, there were no cars that they could drive to take them to California, there were no train tracks that could transport them by train to California, there were no airports that they could fly into California. It's impossible. The first civilian commercially available airport in Los Angeles, Los Angeles County, Southern California didn't actually exist for mass transportation until ~1960 and most people couldn't afford it. Howard Hughes TWA also known as Howard Hughes Trans-World-Airlines as well as Pan American Airlines didn't actually begin taking people to and from Los Angeles, Southern California internationally until ~1950.

Nearly every gang in California was formed together and is held together by [[ethnic]] and [[racial group]] [[sameness]].

===History and Origins In The Southern California Hispanic Lowrider Car Culture===
The phrase: '''Nazi Lowrider''' is a phrase that was [[coined]] by the founders of this [[Car Club]] as members of this [[Car Club]] went to war with their enemy gangs notably the gang known as the '''Cripps''' which is a word that is usually shortened to the word [[Crips]] and is a [[gang]] that was and is exclusively based in Southern California. The '''Nazi Lowriders''' also went to war with the '''Cripp''' counterpart gangs that are known as the [[Bloods]] all throughout the [[1980s]] in Southern California and later they went to war with the ''Cripp'' owned '''Car Club''' collectively known as the [[Druid Car Club]] all throughout the [[1990s]] and the early to mid [[2000s]]. Many of the original '''Cripp''' gang members were part [[Hispanic]] and or mixed with [[Hispanic]] and [[African]] heritage whereas the members of the '''Nazi Lowriders''' were the most racially pure than all others out of all of the '''Lowrider Car Clubs''' in Southern California, hence the phrase: '''Nazi Lowrider'''.

The '''Nazi Lowriders''' became known as pioneers of street craft in Southern California Gangland as they allied with Sureños groups of [[Lamont]], [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]]. Street craft includes killing enemies by drive-by gunfire and then by disposing of the bodies by placing the body into a metal barrel and then by dumping the body into a water canal where the water would slowly dissolve the body into bones over 1 year of flowing water through the canal.

The '''Cripps''' later formed more alliances with the '''Latin-American''' community in Southern California whereas the '''Nazi Lowriders''' formed more alliances with the existing [[Non-Hispanic White]] communities in Southern California and the existing [[White-Hispanic]] communities in Southern California.

The words [[Latino]] and [[Latina]] refer to people who have Latin-American heritage and who also have biological Latin-American ancestry. Latin-American countries are all of the countries that are south of the country of [[México]]. While [[Méxicans]] can be considered [[Hispanic]] because they speak a dialect of the language of [[Spanish]] not all [[Méxican]] [[Citizens]] or [[Méxican]] [[Nationals]] have origins from the country of [[México]] and many Méxicans have both [[American]] [[Indigenous]] and [[Spanish]] ( From [[Spain]] ) heritage whereas [[Californianos]] and [[Californianas]] which are technically multi-generational Californians and are people that descend from the era of [[Spanish California]]. [[Chicanos]] and [[Chicanas]] are a completely different Hispanic group. 99% of Latinos and Latinas are not actually Hispanic because to be Hispanic is to actually have verifiable and provable ancestry from the country of Spain in Europe where the language of Spanish is from. If a person does not actually have ancestry from the country of Spain they are not actually Hispanic, instead they are only Indigenous Americans and they are only Indigenous Americans of the areas that they are from within the Americas.

=Unique Contributions To The Lowrider Car Culture of Southern California=
The founder of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club can be seen with his biological son and his woman in their unique Green Chevrolet Lowrider vehicle in the [[1990]], [[1991]] issues of [[Lowrider Magazine]] of [[Southern California]].

'''Nazi Lowriders''' contributed significant advancements to the '''Lowrider Car Culture''' of Southern California most notably the extended hydraulic suspension engineering schemes where some of their lowrider cars could extend up to 25 feet or more into the air where members could jump through second-story hotel and motel windows to fight enemies as well as to collect money and '''Nazi Lowrider' Lowriders''' that were seen between the [[1980s]] and the [[1990s]] were extremely unique. They also wrote advanced custom [[web application]] [[software]] from the late [[1990s]] to the mid [[2000s]] that could run from any [[Internet]] [[Web Browser]] where that web application software would automatically resize itself to any electronic device display resolution including from low budget and quickly disposable mobile cell phone devices where any of the members could send messages to all members at the same time as well as to any other member specifically to request pick up anywhere including by [[G.P.S. Location]], quickly send orders, make [[VoIP]] phone calls, sell cannabis drug products and more.

This was extremely useful for members to communicate long distance in digital group chats supporting conversations of up to several hundred people simultaneously where S.M.S., M.M.S. and early publicly accessible [[social media]] platforms limited communication speed while traveling with a mobile electronic cell phone or a mobile electronic laptop or notebook computer. This ennabled members to compete with and defeat all enemy gangs in Southern California. The web application software was also very useful for '''Nazi Lowriders''' who traveled in groups through [[Los Angeles County]], [[Southern California]] and [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]]. Copies of this software were given to the allies of the '''Nazi Lowriders''' where the allies then continued development of it into their own versions.

===Nazi Lowrider Software===
The Nazi Lowrider Web Application known with Unix Name: NaziLowriderCMS and NLRCMS began development by the biological son of the founders of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club when he was ~13 years old in the year 2000. NaziLowriderCMS receives its downstream from the same web application project known as CerberusCMS which was also officially registered in the year 2000 in Oildale, Kern County, Southern California by the biological son of the founders of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club when he was ~13 years old. The [[Vagos Motorcycle Club]] requested a development version from him over the Internet in the year ~2001. The web application was originally meant to provide quick, long distance communication over the Internet to Nazi Lowriders after pager devices were phased out of Los Angeles, Southern California.

The [[Vagos Motorcycle Club]] and the [[Hells Angels]] Motorcycle Club were known to have developed a version of this web application software in 2014 where it could compete with the META company owned Ray-Ban Smart Glasses Platform.

From [[2020]] to [[2025]] the [[Nazi Lowriders]] spent another $800 U.S.D. every 28 - 31 days for 48 months equaling approximately $38,000 to $40,000 United States Dollars developing a new base version of this web application software that is now 250,000 lines of programming code and is based on the original web application software programming code logic that was developed between the years of 2000 to 2005. This web application software is now a fully featured and privately accessible social media platform where all members of the [[Nazi Lowriders]] can communicate in mass with each other long distance anywhere they are at instantly. This web application software combined with custom encryption mathematics hosted on parallel web servers connected to combined satellite internet and hardline at home defeats all eavesdropping and all spying. All publicly accessible social media platforms namely: Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram and others in these categories are backdoored and they also allow any law enforcement and any government agencies to actively spy on the private conversations, intercept conversations, pretend to be the conversation participants and more.

This web application software supports all newly released [[smart glasses]] ( regardless of the manufacturer ) with live voice and live video transmission directly to the member profile along with encrypted voice and encrypted video communication directly from the smart glasses. The software also tracks every lowrider and every electronic device connected to it that has a real G.P.S. chip built into it at intervals of every 2 seconds. Every 2 seconds of movement of the lowrider as well as every electronic device that is connected to it is logged to the unique member profile with [[Latitude]], [[Longitude]], [[Altitude]]-To-Sea-Level and device sensor coordinates down to a radius of 3 - 7 feet where every vehicle and every electronic device can also be traced by every other Nazi Lowrider step-by-step every 2 seconds in a 24 hour log file. Nazi Lowriders can trace every other Nazi Lowrider every 2 seconds with last known whereabouts. For instance: if any Nazi Lowrider uses this system all other Nazi Lowriders can see their exact location by G.P.S. coordinates down to a radius of 3 - 7 feet every 2 seconds and they can always work off of their last known wereabouts to find them in person. This web application is approximately 250,000 lines of quality and completely functional programming code as of the year 2025.

Contrary to popular understanding, one computer programmer that is completely experienced in computer programming can only write 10,000 lines of completely functional programming code per 365 days at 6 - 8 hours per day. It is impossible for any one person to write more than 10,000 lines of completely functional programming code per 365 days at 6 - 8 hours per day. 250,000 lines of quality and completely functional programing code would take one computer programmer 25 years to write at 6 - 8 hours per day for 365 days per year.

This web application software makes it almost impossible for anyone else to be logged into the account while the real user is logged into the account and while at the same time it creates completely uniquely generated and random strings upon every reload of the web page document per user and per visitor. This is not to say that the hosting provider itself if used will not give backdoor access to the web application from the actual physically hosted web server where the data on the web server can then be changed at any time by whoever was given backdoor access to the web server. Data would be: audio, document, image and video files. This web application software requires a dedicated server with a small administration team at home in order to prevent unauthorized access.

===Nazi Lowrider Software For Private Security Teams===
'''Nazi Lowriders''' have a team that actively work on private security techniques with use of the Nazi Lowrider custom written web application software. The security teams of 3 - 10 people are capable of watching an entire area by using the ultra high speed 5g LTE networks combined with the live video recording smart glasses while also using the Nazi Lowrider go-bags.

This enables the security teams to protect the individuals and groups tasked for protection such as while going out to a public restaurant, public film, public events and more. With 2 - 3 administrators actively watching the web application and with another 3 - 10 people delivering live voice and video streams to the web application who are monitoring a crowd in an area the administrators can quickly reverse-image search faces from the crowd across ~27 different reverse-image and reverse-video search engines where individuals in the crowd can be successfully identified.

The security teams of 3 - 10 people can actively watch the preparation of food to guarantee food safety, they can actively watch the crowd to guarantee safety of the protectees, record vehicle make and model with license plates in that area and more.

===Nazi Lowrider GoBags===
The [[Nazi Lowriders]] also spent $75,000 developing a set of '''Go-Bags''' between the years of 2016 to 2025 from '''ultra light-weight''' Go-Bags to '''heavy-weight''' Go-Bags and for all different weather conditions in California from hot and dry desert weather conditions to below zero degrees weather conditions to raining weather conditions in desert, coastal and mountain areas.

The Go-Bags and the Go-Bag items are completely customized, security hardened and real-world hardened with a series of hardening techniques to U.S. military issue quality and specifications and some are beyond U.S. military issue quality. The Go-Bags, the custom software and the custom lowriders together enable every Nazi Lowrider to quickly evade and quickly confront law enforcement, military, rival and enemy gangs all over California.

They estimated a base cash income of $2,500 per 28 days along with the combined items enable every '''Nazi Lowrider''' to defeat and evade law enforcement, military, rival and enemy gangs, rival and enemy cartels all over California for the duration of every 28 days of $2,500 base cash income. Techniques include quickly switching vehicles with eachother; staying in paid Hotels, Motels, AirBNB rooms in high-income areas with pre-paid cash cards and more.

The items include security hardened hand-held flashlights with 1,200+ lumens focus capability to U.S. military patrol specifications, unbreakable fixed-blade lanyard loop knives with custom fabricated rubberized metal hand-guards, hand-gun, specific customized boots that ennable up to ~18 miles of walking per day without the risk of foot corns, foot callus, foot fungal infection, foot bacterial infection or sore feet, customized security-hardened Arch-Linux / KDE Plasma Linux / Custom AOSP Mobile Cell Phone that is dirt-proof, shock-proof, fire-proof, water-proof and more. The customized boots can withstand direct caustic soda and other dissolving acids for up to 30 minutes - 8 hours and are completely slip resistant on every surface including with oil on different surfaces with the modifications.

The entire system including the training system enable them to arrive at any point in California within 6 - 12 hours and at any point in Southern California within 0 - 6 hours. The training system enables each Nazi Lowrider to end anyones life within 5 - 6 minutes by using a trade-secret knifing technique that completely drains out all of the 1.5 to 1.6 gallons of blood of that target body in 4 minutes, and whereafter that target body dies completely within the few minutes after all of the blood is completely drained out of that target body. 1.5 - 1.6 gallons of blood weighs approximately 13 - 14 pounds.

The only way to instantly kill a human target is to drain out all of the blood out of that target body and this is a difficult task if the knife used is not long enough and especially if the knife is too flat or slim and of course there is the problem of if the knife has a secure hand-guard to make it impossible for the weilding hand to slip onto that blade and cut the hand when using it, or not. Stabbings do not always end in fatalities unless all of the human organs are hit repeatedly. 90+% of all shootings do not end in instant fatalities even with automatic fire. Contrary to popular belief and contrary to popular understanding: it is actually very difficult to kill someone.

===Nazi Lowrider HygieneBags and HygieneBoxes===
The son of the founders of the [[Nazi Lowriders]] spent several thousand United States Dollars developing a set of Hygiene-Kits, Hygiene-Bags and unbreakable Hygiene-Boxes that can be placed within the Nazi Lowrider Go-Bags and carried into the Nazi Lowrider Lowrider vehicles. The hygiene techniques and the hygiene kits involve thoroughly scrubbing the body with a rock, ultra high quality anti-microbial soaps and techniques to force the teeth to ultra white and ultra strong. The unbreakable Hygiene-Boxes with Hygiene items cost $50 - $60 United States Dollars.

===Nazi Lowrider Travel Systems and Travel Tutorials===
The son of the founders of the [[Nazi Lowriders]] spent 5 years from the years 2020 to 2025 developing a backpacking system and a list of tutorials designed for the gang to evaluate all of the areas to defeat all
of the enemy and rival gangs in the area. The tutorials detail how to keep up with the changes in town and evaluate the areas in order to avoid being killed by the enemy and rival drug gangs. Things like how to kill people based on where they are currently located at in town and what things exist in the area such as broken and jagged street sign metal posts sticking out of the ground and how to beat it yourself while being drugged by the enemy and rival drug gangs.

Usually drug gangs will drug their targets as much as they can and try to get the target into an area that they know and control in order to kill the target without getting caught or to make them look like a fool to everyone else.. This is usually the only way that an enemy drug gang can win. The enemy drug gangs have to get the drugs into the target body in different ways: the food, the drinks, the tobacco, the hospital IV saline bags, by mixing the prescription pills at the pharmacy or any other ways that they can. Examples of killing an enemy target would be: like curb stomping an enemy target head onto the sharp and jagged metal sign post that is sticking out of the ground and then the city removes the sign post to cover up the murder or to correct the area. Between the years of 2017 and 2020 the son of the founders of the [[Nazi Lowriders]] developed a backpacking system and a set of tutorials to defeat all enemy and rival gangs from point-to-point on foot as well as in a vehicle in most places in Southern California.

One Nazi Lowrider slogan is sometimes known as "'''Do Not Slip and Do Not Slide'''". This phrase is sometimes confused with other gangs and it is a common phrase in street gangs. The real Nazi Lowrider slogan is "'''Do Not Slip, Do Not Slide.. Nazi Lowride'''". Nazi Lowriders were usually known to simply drive by in a lowrider vehicle, shoot and or stab the target repeatedly and leave the target body there or possibly dispose of the body into a water canal by placing the target body into a metal barrel and then by sealing the metal barrel and dumping it into the canal. The body of the target would slowly dissolve into bones over 1 year of the water flowing through the canal as the water dissolves the body into bones. This system also helps to identify enemy and rival trafficking networks by using the smart glasses with cameras.

The system shows the member how to customize their property so that it is very unique in the community and none of the items can be bought anywhere by anyone else in order for them to trick a future investigation if the member is killed or dies. By creating unique earrings that cannot be bought anywhere by anyone else and by showing family, friends and allied gangs the unique earrings that were made one can always be found in the community by word of mouth when they go looking for them as long as the earrings are not stolen. For instance: usually by shaving precious mineral stones into customized shapes and by creating jewelry out of those stones that jewelry that is hand made cannot be duplicated or bought by anyone else whereas if anyone buys anything at a jewelry store all of the items that are available at a jewelry store are the exact same items that everyone else buys and owns at the same time. This makes it very easy to be found in the community whereas when everyone has the same thing it makes it very difficult to find people based on word-of-mouth.

===Nazi Lowrider Lowriders===
Another team of the [[Nazi Lowriders]] also spent another $60,000 on a different project from 2020 to 2025 developing a specialized lowrider racing vehicle with advanced hydraulics and nitro cooling systems capable of 24/7 live video recording from the vehicle dash, vehicle mirrors, vehicle rear and with 360 degree rotation of the cameras controllable from the stearing column of the vehicle. This specialized lowrider vehicle is capable of sending up to 720+ Gigabytes of video data at 4K video resolution for 24 hours per day at 5g LTE internet connection speed to the private web server that has this custom web application software installed on. This lowrider racing vehicle was documented with costs of custom engineering, vehicle part customizations, paint jobs, metal reinforcement and more. The lowriders cannot be hijacked unless the window is rolled down due to a large gauge chain that is connected from below the hood to the suspension with a magnetic lock.

In demonstrations: this web application software can support up to ~100 - ~200 concurrent and unique network connections on a shared hosting web server with ultra-fast response, up to ~300 concurrent and unique network connections on a remote dedicated web server with ultra-fast response, up to ~500 concurrent and unique network connections on 2-Parallel private and dedicated web servers and up to ~1,000 concurrent and unique network connections on 3 or more private and dedicated web servers in parallel.

This web application also supports installing custom application modules for infinite expansion of software features and software functionality. In security demonstrations it has proven to be completely secure from and completely invulernable to all known types of digital injection  from basic to advanced digital S.Q.L. Injection Techniques and all others. The entire web application can be used securely without a web application firewall appliance and it also supports custom encryption mathematics.

The web application can be securely accessed with a set of customized mobile cell phones that run a mobile Linux Operating Sytem known as [[Arch Linux]] Mobile, [[KDE Plasma Linux]] Mobile and other fully featured Linux Operating Systems designed for mobile cell phone devices. These operating systems are not based on the Google owned and maintained Android Open Source Software Project. The customized mobile cell phones fit into a custom machined aluminum case that is bulletproof up to .22 caliber, fireproof, waterproof up to 250m, dustproof, shatterproof. The security harded mobile cell phone can be instantly attached to the dash of the vehicle upon entering the vehicle where it can be quickly recharged. The customized Nazi Lowrider smart glasses are capable of wirelessly tethering to the mobile cell phone device.

===Nazi Lowrider Race Vehicles With Hydraulics===
Nazi Lowriders demonstrated in a collection of videos superior auto-engineering and auto-mechanical capabilites. Nazi Lowrider Lowriders are now capable of expert maneuverability and are bullet-proof at the doors of the vehicle up to .40 caliber rounds by using a combined goop that hardens into a bullet proof sheet material after drying. This bullet proof sheet material is several inches thick after drying. The goop is a combination of tar and other chemicals that when dried into a thick sheet and inserted between the outer door and the inner door of the vehicle doors make the doors of the vehicles bullet-proof. The windows are transparent and are also made bullet proof. The engines are made from customized 6-cylinder to 8-cylinder General Motors engine blocks with super charged and ultra high quality parts. The engine part gaskets are an ultra tough and ultra thick custom rubberized material. The vehicle suspension hydraulics enable the driver to manually control the degrees of motion of the cabin of the vehicle from the dash. Unbreakable super hardened metal chains are attached below the hood of the vehicle and dropped down to below the vehicle and locked to make it impossible for anyone to open the hood of the vehicle while locked. This prevents anyone from stealing any vehicle engine parts or destroying any vehicle engine parts when leaving the vehicle.

===Nazi Lowrider Response Times===
Collectively the Nazi Lowriders can arrive at almost any point in Southern California from where they are stationed within Southern California within 0 - 12 hours as well as from Kern County, Southern California and from
Los Angeles County, Southern California. From Kern County, Southern California: Nazi Lowriders can arrive at nearly any point in Los Angeles County, Southern California within <= 300 minutes by using combined road, highway and rail. Nazi Lowriders can also arrive at nearly any point in Los Angeles County, Southern California from any point within Los Angeles County, Southern California within 180 minutes by using combined road, highway and rail from where Nazi Lowriders are stationed from within Los Angeles County, Southern California.

===Banishment of Lowrider Vehicles In California State===
In the [[1990s]] and in the early [[2000s]] in [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] as well as in different cities in [[Los Angeles County]], [[Southern California]] numerous city officials within these counties banned '''Lowrider Racing Vehicles''' with [[hydraulics]] because the lowrider gangs could easily beat all of the [[Law Enforcement]] and the [[Military]] everywhere in [[California]] by using those engineered lowrider vehicles. Law Enforcement could not keep up with the speed of the '''Lowrider Racing Vehicles with Hydraulics''' and no one could hide from the [[maneuverability]] of those vehicles. Some '''Nazi Lowriders''' were known to have extended suspension hydraulics that could not be mimicked by other lowrider gangs where the entire vehicle could be raised sometimes up to 25 feet or more into the air with hydraulics as well as to tactically shield from enemy gun fire.

=Membership Requirements=
The original '''Nazi Lowriders''' required specific criteria for Nazi Lowrider Car Club membership.

===Founders of The Nazi Lowrider Car Club===
The Founding members of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club are now dead. This car club is now defunct and does not operate.

===Burial Requirements===
Nazi Lowriders required pre-planned burial requirements and to have already paid for their funerary arrangements before becoming active in the Nazi Lowrider Car Club. The Nazi Lowrider Car Club required members to have taken pictures and videos of themselves in their caskets while still young, while looking really clean and healthy and while wearing nice clothing before actually dying so that upon actual death if any piece of the body of that Nazi Lowrider member or the entire body of that Nazi Lowrider member is recovered it can be buried according to the funerary requirements. Nazi Lowriders are required to be buried with a pure silver Swaztika set of earrings or necklace in addition to the custom Nazi Lowrider Roman Catolic Rosary.

===Citizenship Requirements===
U.S. Citizenship is required.

===Clothing and Jewelry Requirements===
Nazi Lowriders are required to have custom clothing made from materials that are grown in the Southern part of the U.S. State of California. All jewelry must be custom made and made from precious minerals and precious metals either from the U.S. State of California or from the South Western region of the United States.

===Language and Ancestral Heritage Requirements ( Royal Ancestry Required )===
The original '''Nazi Lowriders''' required members to know and speak [[Spanish]] of mainland Spain and [[Western-German]], prove specific and [[rare]] [[Hispanic]] [[ancestral]] [[heritage]] from parent-to-parent to any King of Spain, but no [[Latin American]] heritage and no [[Negroid]] heritage otherwise known as [[Latino]] and [[Latina]]. People with any [[Latin American]] heritage were not allowed membership in the '''Nazi Lowrider Car Club''' or the '''Nazi Lowrider Prison Gang''' because 90%+ of the entire Latino and Latina population group have negroid ancestry from the african slaves that were brought to Central America and South America by the Spanish Catholic Church of the 16th Century, 17th Century, 18th Century, 19th Century and the the 20th Century. The Nazi Lowriders later officially recognized 1 part Latino and 1 part Latina members who had later joined the Vagos Motorcycle Club in ~1988 before some members of the Vagos Motorcycle Club were seen doing business with Blacks and Russians. These Nazi Lowriders are now aged in their 70s.

Membership in the Nazi Lowrider Car Club requires multi-generational Californian ancestry and to have been born in Southern California. The Nazi Lowriders later restricted membership to Non-Latino Non-Hispanic White.

The son of the founders of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club developed a special language learning system that he named: Lightning Language starting in the year ~2007 where the student can learn and completely retain up to 15 new words in any language every 24 hours with permanent memory retention and if the student applies the memorization techniques to that language every day for up to 365 days that student will know up to 5,475 words in that language at the end of the 365 days. These are considered genius memorization skills whereas when a high percentage of the population attempts to completely memorize 15 new words in any language in 24 hours they usually completely forget the words the next day or they partially forget the words the next day or within a few days. This is known as short-term memory retention loss. The memorization techniques are based on combined memorization techniques that draw from Simonides of Ceos' [[Method of Loci]]. This learning system is meant for new Nazi Lowrider members to learn mainland Spanish so that they can instantly see the differences between all of the different dialects of Spanish that are spoken in California. He also developed a system to show the public that anyone can be a human mental calculator where they can memorize 180+ actual mathematical algorithms by using the Simoniodes of Ceos' [[Method of Loci]] combined with other memorization techniques. He developed several unique mathematical algorithms to add to this collection of 182 unique mathematical algorithms.

===Material Memorization Requirements===
The '''Nazi Lowriders''' of the year 2025 now require that members memorize the entire California Penal Code and the entire California Government Code word-by-word by using the Simonides of Ceos' memorization techniques developed by the biological son of the founders of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club. Memorization of all of the codes word-by-word takes up to 365 days.

===Financial Requirements===
The '''Nazi Lowriders''' of the year 2025 now require that members own at least $1 worth of every Crypto Currency available. As of the year 2025 the number of Crypto Currency types are around ~350 completely unique and different Crypto Currencies. This includes BITCoin, RavenCoin, DogeCoin and more. They are required to have a special collection of pre-paid debit cards and clean credit in order to master short-range and long-range travel within [[Southern California]]. They are also required to have a 401K savings plan that is specifically setup to be impervious to garnishment, confiscation and theft.

===Dental and Hygiene Requirements===
The '''Nazi Lowriders''' of the year 2025 now require that members have excellent hygiene and excellent dental hygiene with a full set of teeth that is higher than U.S. Military standards. The reasoning behind this policy is that as stated by the biological son of the founders of the Nazi Lowriders: "One cannot endure war and also battle the enemy if the teeth hurt".

===Health Requirements===
The ''Nazi Lowriders'' of the year 2025 now require that members have excellent physical health, exercise regularly and maintain excellent physical health.

===Vehicle Ownership Requirements===
'''Nazi Lowriders''' also required members to own a specific [[Chevrolet]] [[Vehicle]] with or without [[hydraulics]]. Lowrider Chevrolet vehicles were required in order to beat all of the street-level gangs who roamed the streets without vehicles as well as to beat all of the enemy and rival Lowrider gangs. Members were also required to own a hand gun so that member could engage in drive by shootings on their enemies from their lowrider vehicle. Hydraulics were later necessary in order to beat all of the enemies that hid in motels and hotels in Southern California as well as to tactically defend against gun fire from enemy gangs. Chevrolet vehicles that were manufactured between the 1960s to the late 1970s had extremely tough and high quality metals where [[.22]] [[caliber]] and [[.40]] [[caliber]] rounds could not penetrate through the metals if the vehicle doors and the vehicle frames were reinforced with bullet proof goop and bullet proof mechanisms.

===Nazi Lowrider Gang Colors and Roman Catholic Rosary Requirements===
While Nazi Lowriders are not required to be a member of the Roman Catholic Church as most are not, they are required to know how to build a Roman Catholic Rosary from scratch in a specific set of colors and pattern with a set number of rosary decades. Nazi Lowriders are required to know Nazi Lowrider gang colors.

===Motorcycle Ownership Requirements===
Nazi Lowriders that own a motorcycle are required to own an American Indian Motorcycle where all parts of that Indian motorcycle are made in the continental U.S.A and with materials that are mined from within the continental U.S.A.

===Official Jackets===
Officially sponsored Nazi Lowriders are required to wear a specific type of leather jacket made from buffalo / bison leather with the logo of the Nazi Lowrider Street Car Club on the back of the jacket.

===Identity Requirements===
Officially sponsored Nazi Lowriders and new recruits are required to have a valid California State driver license, clean credit and a clean record. If any Nazi Lowriders encounter legal troubles the gang will act to protect.

===Dietary Requirements===
Officially sponsored Nazi Lowriders are not allowed to touch, consume or eat any food from any fast food restaurants or from any restaurants or from any places where anyone touches the food or prepares the food for them. The food is required to be completely sealed, untampered, unopened and directly from the food manufacturer. All food and drink items are required to be completely organic. This is to prevent any possibilty of consuming poisoned food and drinks or any food and drinks that could be contaminated with human bodily fluids.

===Official Sponsorship and Support===
Nazi Lowriders require official sponsorship from senior membership as well as support from family for official recognition as a Nazi Lowrider. Family support requires family hand making their motorcycle jackets, hand making their clothing ( if necessary ), monetary support, safety support, knowing their wearabouts, food security and food safety and more.

=Nazi Lowrider Car Club Politics and Nazi Lowrider Gang Politics=
Nazi Lowriders have their own unique and specific car club policies, car club politics, car club rules of conduct and more. The previously mentioned car club politics and car club policies are different from their prison gang politics, prison gang rules of conduct, prison policies and others.

'''Policies, Politics and Rules of Punishment'''
* Anyone who claims membership in the Nazi Lowriders Car Club or the Nazi Lowriders Prison Gang and who is not a member of the Nazi Lowriders or related to a Nazi Lowrider is subject to stabbing.
* Anyone who betrays their biological family or their Nazi Lowrider Family will be punished accordingly and will be cast out and declared a non-member.
* Show Lowrider Vehicles must be clean and presentable.

=Organizational Efforts=
The Nazi Lowrider Car Club collectively for several decades have become more and more organized from and after their origins. The founder of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club spent several years establishing interpersonal relationships with new members as most gang membership bases are biologically related. By 1993 in Los Angeles, Southern California -- Law Enforcement had documented 23 - 28 completely validated members of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club as they had observed Nazi Lowrider gang activity thoroughout [[Los Angeles]], [[Los Angeles County]], [[Southern California]]. Law Enforcement stated that they suspected that there were more members of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club and that they would need to investigate this car club to see how many members there were. By the year 2000 it was suspected that there were several hundred members of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club, but this was never legally proven. Membership in gangs and in car clubs requires legal proof. Legal proof of membership in gangs and car clubs require long histories of criminal acts and associations with previously validated members. The biological son of the founder of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club has stated that he remembers approximately 20 members of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club and the Nazi Lowrider Street Gang from when he was a child in the years of the early to mid 1990s as he met all of them in person and had good, healthy personal relationships with all of them, but he does not remember there being 1,000 members because there are not 1,000 members.

===Support For Members of The Nazi Lowriders===
'''Academic Collection of Human Memory Techniques and Academic Support'''
* The son of the founder of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club spent 15+ years in his spare time developing language learning systems, knowledge memorization systems and mental mathematics systems to send to incarcerated members of the Nazi Lowriders in California jails and in California prisons. The knowledge system gives great memory enhancement allowing for memorizing an entire language within 365 days, memorizing entire books and mentally multiplying exponentially. He also developed a system for counting cards as well as several other memory systems. The human memory systems are based on Simonides of Ceos' [[Method of Loci]]. The language memorization system can compete with memorization systems given out to academics, film actors and government.

'''Entry Level Computer Science'''
* The son of the founders of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club is known to teach entry level computer science to several members of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club. This involves real-life information security, digital information security, computer exploits: S.Q.L. Injection, X.S.S. Scripting/Injection, Buffer Injections and more. He was privately taught entry level computer science from 2016 - 2020 and was previously self-taught.

===Mechanical Support For Nazi Lowriders===
'''Inexpensive and High Quality Customized Motorbike Transportation'''
* The son of the founder of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club spent ~$5,000 United States Dollars perfecting an engineering scheme for a set of induro motorcycles made from high quality parts that can be built for $350 - $500 - $750 United States Dollars from the years 2014 - 2016. The engineering system and the motorbike parts can be reproduced from a guide that he created. The guide shows where to order all of the motorbike parts / where to get all of the motorbike parts, how to customize the motorbike parts, how to machine manufacture some of the motorbike parts and how to build the motorbike. The motorbikes feature direct gasoline injection or direct ethanol injection, a customized and metal hardened 2 - 3 cylinder motor or more than 3 cylinders motor with high quality rubberized gaskets, high quality wide pistons and ultra high quality head metals, ultra high quality top-grade titanium nuts and bolts, liquid engine cooling system, Dunlop dirt bike tires with all terrain billets, ultra strong wide gauge chain and more. The motorbikes can be built in <= 30 days and they can be used to quickly transport product. The motorbikes last for up to ~8 months of every day use before requiring part replacements and can achieve of speed of 45 miles-per-hour on level surface without cut-off on sharp turns, 40 miles-per-hour on incline surface without cut-off and up to 60 miles-per-hour on decline surface without cut-off.

* It is known that another member of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club spent several thousand United States Dollars perfecting a futuristic and extremely high quality custom made motorcycle made from American Indian Motorcycle parts that can be recreated for $4,000 United States Dollars.

'''High Quality Lowrider Vehicles With Hydraulics'''
* Another team of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club perfected an engineering model from several different 1970s Chevrolets that feature futuristic engineering. Video demonstrations of these futuristic Lowrider Chevrolets with hydraulics were made from 2012 - 2014.

=Power Struggles Within The Nazi Lowriders=
After 1997 and after the interactions between the son of the founder of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club and a high ranking boss of the [[Sinaloa Cartel]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[Los Angeles County]], [[Southern California]] the Nazi Lowriders experienced internal power struggles within their organization as one of their senior members began efforts of recruiting Non-Hispanic Whites into the Nazi Lowrider Car Club. Senior leadership of the Nazi Lowriders opposed the recruitment efforts because the Nazi Lowriders have origins in the Hispanic Lowrider Car Community of [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] and of [[Los Angeles]], [[Los Angeles County]] [[Southern California]].

The [[Aryan Brotherhood]] and the [[Hells Angels]] began recruiting numerous members into the '''Aryan Brotherhood''' and the '''Hell's Angels''' through the initiation of Non-Hispanic White recruits from [[Central California]] and from [[Southern California]] mostly from the areas of [[Long Beach]], [[Southern California]]. The '''Aryan Brotherhood''' and the '''Hell's Angels''' as a whole entity are linked together and they are known to be connected to Non-Hispanic White Law Enforcement that cover up their crimes.

In the U.S. State of California: English and Spanish are the primarily spoken languages. In the U.S. State of Hawaii: English, Hawaiian and Japanese are the primarily spoken languages. In the U.S. States that border Eastern-Canada: English and Canadian-French are the primarily spoken languages. In the U.S. States that border Western-Canada ( British Columbia ) American-English, Canadian-French and British-English are the primarily spoken languages.

In California: the primarily spoken languages are English and different dialects of Spanish because California was formerly owned by the [[Spanish Empire]] where it originally extended down to the areas that are now known as México. California was purchased by the expanding U.S. population as the Spanish Empire sold it off to the U.S. Government and California feeds nearly the entire U.S. population because California can grow food crops 365 days a year without any crop freeze. No other area in the U.S. is capable of this and these are some of the reasons why the U.S. Government wants complete control of California. The U.S. Government' mission is to expell all Hispanics, Indigenous and the world of Hispania from California so that Non-Hispanic Whites can move in and take everything.

The Nazi Lowriders have strong ties with several [[Chicano]] Car Clubs and their original missions were to protect all family in the Nazi Lowrider Car Club and all of their families in [[California]] as well as to preserve the culture of their Car Club in [[Southern California]] and to defend their streets and areas in [[Southern California]] from their enemies.

The original [[Nazi Lowrider Car Club]] as well as the [[Chicano Car Club]] opposed the waves of [[Non-Hispanic White]] immigration into [[California]] because these population groups take away from all of the resources of [[California]] and they are not from [[California]]. [[California]] belongs to the population groups that are multi-generationally descended from [[California]] and [[California]] should not benefit people who are not from [[California]]. These population groups would be [[Indigenous]] who are multi-generationally descended from [[California]], [[Mestizo]] who are multi-generationally descended from [[California]], [[Chicano]] who are multi-generationally descended from [[California]], [[Hispanics]] who are multi-generationally descended from [[California]] and anyone else who is multi-generationally descended from [[California]], but not to anyone else. These privileges were later extended to the multi-generationally descended from the immigration of the affected of the '''Dust Bowl''' from [[Oklahoma]] into [[Southern California]] from the [[1930s]] who were forced to live in the [[California Concentration Camps]] and the California [[Dust Bowl Camps]] in [[Lamont]], [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]], but not to anyone else. Because the '''Dust Bowl''' only affected certain areas of [[Oklahoma]] and it did not affect any other areas in the U.S.. The remains, including the remaining destroyed buildings and houses of the areas in [[Oklahoma]] that were affected by the [[Dust Bowl]] can still be seen today. These areas are hard to travel to and one cannot travel there by vehicle, by train or by airplane. The entire area was sealed off to the public in approximately ~1950 after they sent scouts to these areas and they found hundreds if not thousands of decaying human corpses who died there due to suffocation from the non-stop dust storms and from starvation as well as from the inability to drive anywhere or walk anywhere to get food or resources. Most of the dead who died in the [[Dust Bowl]] were not buried during the decades of the [[Dust Bowl]]. The dead were left in their houses or outside and were found decaying from the years of 1934 to 1950. The scouts who traveled to these areas and walked into the remaining houses saw the dead decaying in their beds and they saw the dead decaying outside in the fields. The people who made it out of the '''Dust Bowl''' are considered to be very fortunate to have done so. The officially purported histories on the Dust Bowl are completely false and censored.

The Nazi Lowriders and the Chicanos have fully documented and proven the fraud of the U.S. Government as the U.S. Government have slowly changed U.S. Government maintained records on their end to be more consistent in lies so that they can slowly take complete ownership of California by creating fictitious legal rights for themselves. These records include changed details in newspaper clippings, changed news reports, changed migration records, including fraudulent and completely made up histories created by the U.S. Government and its controlled churches, changed census records and more. The U.S. Government and corrupt law are known to entirely delete / purge / destroy records so as to make it to where their enemies can not prove anything against them or prove earlier logical events that prove them wrong.

===Power Differences In The Aryan Brotherhood and The Hell's Angels===
The '''Aryan Brotherhood''' and the '''Hell's Angels''' were known to have made connections with different [[Italian Criminal Families]] in [[Southern California]] and later with [[Irish Criminal Families]] abroad. Being a primarily [[Hispanic]] and [[White Hispanic]] car club, the Nazi Lowriders experienced internal power struggles to maintain peace with some of these [[Non-Hispanic White]] population groups.
Initially the [[Nazi Lowriders]] had stronger connections with the [[Sinaloa Cartel]] of [[Southern California]] because its members were primarily part [[Hispanic]] whereas the '''Aryan Brotherhood''' and the '''Hell's Angels''' are [[Non-Hispanic White]]. In fact, the '''Aryan Brotherhood''' and the '''Hell's Angels''' do not actually recruit anyone who is not of pure Non-Hispanic White Ethnicity.

===What Are The Sinaloa Mexican Cartel ?===
The Sinaloa Mexico Cartel also known as the Sinaloa Cartel is divided into several different interrelated families who are of direct multi-generational descent from [[Sinaloa]], [[México]] and who live in either [[California]] of the territory of what is now widely known as the [[United States]] or in [[Sinaloa]], [[Mexico]]. Membership in the Sinaloa Cartel requires provable ancestral descent from [[Sinaloa]], [[México]]. All real Sureños, Sureñas and Norteños, Norteñas have direct multi-generational descent from [[Sinaloa]], [[México]]. Anyone claiming to be a Sureño, Sureña or a Norteño, Norteña and who does not have verifiable multi-generational ancestry from [[Sinaloa]], [[México]] is a fraud. In the 1990s and in the 2000s several Southern California Sinaloan families intermarried with Northern Californian Sinaloan families and ended their territorial disputes in the criminal world.

===What Are The Tijuana Mexican Cartel ?===
The Tijuana Mexican Cartel also known simply as the Tijuana Cartel is divided into several different interrelated families who are of direct multi-generational descent from [[Tijuana]], [[Baja California]], [[Mexico]] and who live in either [[California]] of the territory of what is now widely known as the [[United States]] or in [[Tijuana]], [[Baja California]], [[Mexico]]. Membership in the Tijuna Mexican Cartel requires provable multi-generational ancestral descent from [[Tijuana]], [[Baja California]], [[Mexico]]. The Tijuana Mexican Cartel usually operates in [[Southern California]] of the areas that are now known as the [[United States]] as well as in [[Tijuana]], [[Baja California]], [[Mexico]].

===What Are Los Zetas Mexican Cartel ?===
The Zetas Mexican Cartel also known simply as Los Zetas Cartel is divided into several different interrelated families who are of direct multi-generational descent from [[Veracruz]], [[Mexico]] and who live in either of the territory of what is now widely known as the [[United States]] or in [[Veracruz]], [[Mexico]]. Membership in the Zetas Mexican Cartel requires provable multi-generational ancestral descent from [[Veracruz]], [[Mexico]].

===What Are The Aryan Brotherhood ?===
The Aryan Brotherhood traces its roots to Central-California Prisons and Southern-California Prisons in the early years of the 1970s. Aryan Brotherhood membership was restricted to males that fit certain criteria for membership and required them to be pure Aryan of the original academic concepts of the Aryan Race and to have blue eye color. There is no Aryan Brotherhood of Texas. This is a fictitious entity. The Aryan Brotherhood was founded in Central-California and in Southern-California at the earliest in the years of the 1970s. The original Aryan Brotherhood does not operate outside of the U.S. State of California.

===What Are The Hell's Angels Motorcycle Club ?===
Collectively the Hell's Angels Motorcycle Club are several unique motorcycle clubs and unique support motorcycle clubs that became united under the banner of name: Hell's Angels Motorcycle Club or simply '''The Hell's Angels''' whereas the original members of the Hell's Angels Motorcycle Club were formed in Southern California and some were female bikers. In [[Hispania]] the male members of the Hell's Angels Motorcycle Club are known collectively as '''Angelios del Diablo''' or '''Male Angels of the Devil''' and the female members of the Hell's Angels Motorcycle Club are known as '''Angelias del Diablo''' or '''Female Angels of the Devil''' where the '''Devils''' are the men and the '''Angels''' are the women. This motorcycle club can be traced back to the mid to late 1960s in Southern California. Membership in the Hell's Angels Motorcycle Club requires Non-Hispanic White Ethnicity and to kill someone with another validated member of the Hell's Angels Motorcycle Club.

===What Are The Vagos Motorcycle Club ?===
Collectively the '''Vagos Motorcycle Club''' are the '''Vagos''' or '''Male''' members of the Vagos Motorcycle Club and their '''Vagas''' which are the female members of the '''Vagos Motorcycle Club'''. The word '''Vagos''' in a dialect of the Spanish language translates to a '''Vagabond''' or a '''Traveling Gypsy''' in the English language and the original members of the '''Vagos Motorcycle Club''' were of full or partial Hispanic ancestry. The origins of the [[Vagos Motorcycle Club]] can be traced to [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] as early as the late 1960s and they had a presence in [[Lancaster]], [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] in the late 1980s and the early 1990s. The original requirements for membership in the '''Vagos Motorcycle Club''' required certain Hispanic ancestry.

=Connections=

Nazi Lowriders are known to have connections with the '''Hell's Angels Motorcycle Club''' of [[Oildale]], [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] and previously the '''Hell's Angels Motorcycle Club''' of [[Long Beach]], [[Los Angeles County]], [[Southern California]] as well as the '''Vagos Motorcycle Club''' of [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] throughout the 1990s. They do not have any connections with any other motorcycle clubs. The Wikipedia article on Nazi Lowriders claim that the Nazi Lowriders have connections with the Mongols Motorcycle Club, but they don't and they never did. The '''Mongols Motorcycle Club''' have connections with the enemies of the Nazi Lowriders.

===Motorcycle Clubs===
Nazi Lowriders are known to have connections with [[motorcycle clubs]] the [[Vagos Motorcycle Club|Vagos Motorcycle Club]] of [[Southern California]] and the [[Hells Angels Motorcycle Club|Hell's Angels Motorcycle Club]] of [[Southern California]].

'''Vagos Motorcycle Club'''
* The Vagos Motorcycle Club were originally an all Hispanic Motorcycle Club because the word '''Vagos''' in the language of Spanish translates to '''Traveling Gypsy''' and '''Vagabond''' in the language of English.
* The Nazi Lowriders are known to have worked for x1 band of the Vagos Motorcycle Club in what was formerly known as [[Lancaster]], [[Kern County]] in [[Southern California]] in the early 1990s before [[Los Angeles County]] purchased the city and territory of Lancaster from [[Kern County]].

'''Hell's Angels Motorcycle Club'''
* Some Nazi Lowriders are known to have hid out several [[Hell's Angels]] motorcycle club members in [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] throughout the late 1990s and the early 2000s and they are known to have worked for the [[Hell's Angels]] Motorcycle Club around [[Oildale]], [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] in the late 1990s and the early 2000s. They protected and hid out several Hell's Angels members in [[Kern County]] from different Hell's Angels satellite motorcycle clubs providing safe and clean environment, clean food and clean clothing.

===Lowrider Car Clubs===
Nazi Lowriders also have connections with several different Chicano and Chicana Car Clubs from the ancestry of the founders of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club. The founders of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club have ancestry in the United Farm Workers Movement namely where the biological son of the founder of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club has a great grandmother whose name was '''Georgia Hiawatha Jennings''' and who greatly assisted in the '''United Farm Workers''' of Kern County, Southern California from the 1960s to the 1970s. The '''United Farm Workers''' were part of the Chicano Movement in Kern County, Southern California and the Chicano Movement of Southern California is linked to the Chicano Car Clubs and the Chicana Car Clubs.

'''Georgia Hiawatha Jennings''' was a partially ancestrally American Indian migrant from the affected areas of the [[Dust Bowl]] in [[Indian Territory]] which later officialy became known as [[Oklahoma]] after 1920. She was also shown in 2 low budget [[Hollywood]] Films that were filmed around [[Bakersfield]], [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] in the 1950s and in the 1960s. One film was named: '''Better In Black''' and she may have been an extra in the original cut of the 1967 Hollywood Film [[Hell's Angels on Wheels]] in the filming location around [[Hart Park]] in [[East Bakersfield]], [[Southern California]], but this was never confirmed by the staff of the film. [[Jack Nicolson]] has stated in a video that he does not remember seeing '''Georgia Hiawatha Jennings''' on the set of the Hollywood film [[Hell's Angels on Wheels]], but she may have been seen walking in the background of the filming location of [[Hart Park]] in [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] as the original film showed a theme park there with a roller coaster. It is known that a few Nazi Lowriders and Jack Nicolson have had sex together with call girls in [[Los Angeles]], [[Southern California]]. Much of the film '''Hell's Angels on Wheels''' was recorded in [[Hart Park]] in East Bakersfield, Southern California where '''Georgia Hiawatha Jennings''' resided during this time.

=Gentrification of Cities In Southern California=
Nazi Lowriders assisted in the [[gentrification]] of several different cities in [[Los Angeles County]], [[Southern California]] as well as of several different cities in [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]]. Notably [[Oildale]], [[Southern California]] and [[East Bakersfield]], [[Southern California]] in [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] throughout the [[1980s]] and the early to mid [[1990s]] as well as of several different cities in [[Los Angeles County]], [[Southern California]] notably: [[South Gate]], [[Southern California]]. Nazi Lowriders assisted in these gentrifications and advancements because it was worth money. The Nazi Lowriders did not start as a [[Neo-Nazi]] gang, but it became known as one as it allied with a few Non-Hispanic White gangs of [[Southern California]] after [[1996]].

The film [[American History X]] was inspired by the stories of community development and community gentrification of [[Long Beach]], [[Southern California]] and of [[Compton]], [[Southern California]] by a few fictitious Non-Hispanic White families shown in the film where elements of that fictitious family were based on real families who resided in [[Long Beach]], [[Southern California]].

[[Long Beach]], [[Southern California]] is only ~10 miles south of [[Compton]], [[Los Angeles County]], [[Southern California]] and the gang wars between Compton, Southern California and Long Beach, Southern California carried into the 2000s. It was actually the Nazi Lowriders that helped pave the way for the Non-Hispanic Whites to move into [[Long Beach]], [[Los Angeles County]], [[Southern California]] throughout the [[1980s]] and the [[1990s]]. [[Long Beach]], [[Southern California]] was gentrified by Non-Hispanic White Southern California gangs known as the Long Beach Gangs.

=Notable Nazi Lowriders and Notable Nazi Lowrider Family=
There are several notable members of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club as well as notable family members of members of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club.

===The Original Nazi Lowriders===
'''The Biological Son of The Founders of The Nazi Lowrider Car Club'''
* The biological son of the founders of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club who apparently is part Hispanic has stated as a child that he was ashamed of his Hispanic heritage and his American Indian heritage, but later he stated that he is now glad to know of his Hispanic descent from Spain.
* In 2008 he began mining BITCoin and acquired several whole BITCoins in addition to paying $1 a piece for 100 whole BITCoins in ~2009. His 100 BITCoins that were purchased were lost online after the year 2009. 100 whole BITCoins as of the year 2025 collectively are worth 10 million United States Dollars.
* He is known to have talked to [[Charles Manson]] at the Dignity Health Memorial Hospital in ~2010 when Charles Manson was hospitalized there. He is known to have stated that he did not believe that Charles Manson was guilty.
* He is known to have brushed shoulders with several famous and infamous people.
* He has stated that while he is not against others using drugs, he himself is not a drug user and he likes to keep his body completely healthy.
* He has stated that he is 100% heterosexual and that although the official social system in place would classify him as being sexually molested by numerous different women growing up, he himself does not feel sexually molested and he loves all of the women he was with sexually when he was a child and a teenager.
* He has stated that he dislikes, evades, does not communicate with any cops or with any military and he has actively filtered out any influence by leos and military because "they are all spies", and that "the only way anyone can actually kill someone and completely get away with it is when their spies are no longer watching".
* He has stated that he was never sexually molested by anyone in the Nazi Lowrider Car Club or by any of the members of its car club allies, but when he was 6 years old after a car race between the Nazi Lowriders and a rival car club in East Los Angeles, Southern California his father ordered a teenager chola to suck his son's penis and she did. His son later had a short romantic relationship with her.
* He has stated that he was ordered to marry a French-Californian princess with authentic royal French ancestry when he was 7 or 8 years old who was a few years older than him, but they were later separated.
* He has stated in the year 2014 that he no longer calls upon any law enforcement in any circumstance because they "get paid tax payer money to protect and serve themselves and their families and they don't give a shit about anyone else anyway". and the phrase "to protect and serve" actually means to protect the court they work for and to serve the paperwork of the court they work for. It does not actually mean to protect and serve the community.. and what they actually do is cover up all of eachother's crimes with phony documentation anyway.
* He has stated that he is not a member of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club or of any other gang, but his biological parents are the founders of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club.
* He has stated that because he looks like a model naturally and he has been accussed by corrupt law enforcement and enemy gangs as having received or undergone plastic surgery to look like a model because they are jealous of him. He stated that he is 100% natural born male and he has never received any kind of facial surgeries or any plastic surgeries because plastic surgery involves placing plastic in the face in a surgery and anyone who receives plastic surgery can be punched in the face to break all of the plastic in their face. He proved that he never received any kind of surgeries like that in order to rebut any statements made by enemies. He also proved that he can always prove that he is the real person and that he is the same person from when he was a child and from when he was born because he attended 2 private schools in youth in Kern County, Southern California in addition to everyone in his hometown in Kern County, Southern California knowing about him and they can always prove that he is the real person. He is of partial Hispanic ancestry.
* He has stated that he is not a member of the Catholic Church, he is not a Catholic and he is not a priest, but his grandmother was and she her funeral services and rites were held at CTK Roman Catholic Parish in Bakersfield, Kern County, Southern California. He was offered to become a priest before he was 18 years old, but he declined stating that he loves women to much. He has also stated that he is not religous and he does not care about religion, instead he only cares about true freedom.
* He has stated that he had partially went through the process of relinquishment of U.S. Citizenship and U.S. Nationality to become completely stateless and sovereign from the years of 2016 - 2020 and he could still complete the process in order to completely drop U.S. Citizenry. He is a traceable ~20th Generation European-American descended and at least a ~50th generation American Indian descended from the areas of what is now known as the U.S. IF he completes the relinquishment of U.S. Citizenship and U.S. Nationality process he will be invalidated as a U.S. Citizen and will retain citizenship in his American Indian Nations that are federally recognized within the continental U.S.. He has verifiable descent from the Cherokee / Tsalagi American Indian Nation and an Apache American Indian Nation from what is now known as the South West U.S. and from the South Central U.S. and he also might be directly descended from both Christian III King of Denmark and Norway as well as Christian VIII King of Denmark and Norway and he is also directly descended from the Kings of Spain Louis Alfonse de Bourbon / King Phillip V through his 6th great grandfather Michel Antoine Garoutte. His other grandfather was a member of the American Indian Movement of New Mexico State from the 1950s to the 1990s.
* He has stated that his name was changed from a Spanish name in the year ~1991 in [[Bakersfield]], [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] after his biological father who was the founder of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club, died. His half-blood relatives adopted him and changed his name to Gary Christopher Johnson through the Kern County Courts and his county-level birth certificate was amended to display the name: Gary Christopher Johnson.
* He has stated that he is proud of his Native American / American Indian ancestry from Oklahoma State and New Mexico State and he is of partial 'Nde and Athabaskan Apache descent from the Chihuahuan Desert in Northern Mexico formerly known as the Sonoran Desert in Northern Mexico below what is now known as New Mexico State by Carlsbad and is of 'Nde and Athabaskan Apache descent from Southern New Mexico and he is of partial Cherokee and Choctaw descent from what is now known as Oklahoma State and from Missouri State.

'''Doppelgänger Attacks and Identity Takeovers Explained Step-By-Step'''

Nazi Lowriders, especially the biological son of the founder of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club have experienced doppelgänger attacks and identity fraud. Identity fraud by doppelgänger's involves a lookalike of the real person that moves into a house in the same area as the real person that looks like them and then begins to use their identity in the same locations and or in the same areas, but in different exact locations that are within the same areas in order to trick the U.S. Government identity systems on record as well as to trick the U.S. Government about the exact whereabouts of the real person by last-known-whereabouts techniques for actually finding people. This can trick the CIA and the U.S. Navy of the actual whereabouts of the real person until the doppelgänger of the real person who is in the enemy or rival criminal organization can then kill the real person and dispose of the body of the real person and then take over the real person's entire identity.

'''The Simplist Way To Kill A Lookalike And Takeover Their Identity'''

The easiest and most simple way to kill a lookalike and take over their identity is to find them and kill them and then take their identity card. Once the identity card is in possession one can then use the identity card anywhere in town while disposing of the body of the real person. Usually people do not check the pictures of the real people on the identity card in detail and they will automatically assume that it is the real person using the identity card. Accounts at banks, phone companies and more can be opened using the identity card of the real person. Every 7 years in most U.S. States the biometric databases are cleared. Usually only California and Hawaii take fingerprints in order to get an ID card at the Department of Motor Vehicles where 7 years after the fingerprints are deleted from the database. Once the fingerprints are deleted from the database the Doppelgänger can then take the birth certificate and the social security card of the real person to the Department of Motor Vehicles and proceed to get an identity card / driver license in the real person's name and information in the same county and area that the real person got the identity card before. Because the U.S. Government and the Department of Motor Vehicles do not take a picture of the side of the head of the people that get identity cards at the Department of Motor Vehicles that means the U.S. Government does not know what the side of the head of the real person looks like.. only the family and friends of the real person know what the side of the head of the real person looks like. Since the U.S. Government does not know what the side of the head of the real person looks like no one can prove or legally prove who the real person is.. not even the real person can prove or legally prove that they are the real person.. to anyone. If there is a larger gang with more members hanging around in the area they can kill their targets and get away with it without leaving any evidence behind. There is absolutely no proof because the Department of Motor Vehicles deletes the previous pictures and the fingerprints from the databases every 7 years. Usually only the length of the bridge between the eyes in the picture, the neck, the ears and small details of the facial features are trustworthy. Gangs and cartels will usually begin living in the targets house after they have killed their targets and they will dress up in their clothing and have all of the target family pictures replaced with pictures of themselves while claiming to be the real people. If friends and family report this to the U.S. Government and Law Enforcement often times they will continue letting them get away with it or they are so stupid that they get away with it because by reporting it the gang and or cartel gets even more legally associated with the friends of the real people and they can't legally prove them wrong. There are hundreds of different ways to kill someone and take their identity over. One can also kill someone who does not look like them and take over their identity by simply killing them and then by gluing their picture onto the identity card of the real person or by manufacturing a fake identity card with an identity card manufacturing machine with their picture on the real person's identity card information. The identity card would have the same identity card number, address and all of the same details. They could then go around town and trick the databases around town about the actual whereabouts of the real person and then send gang members to kill the real person and dispose of the body. After the body has been disposed of they could then crop themselves into the target family's pictures online and then print them out and continue to be the real person on record until they become the real person on record.

'''How Does The CIA and the U.S. Navy Track People ?'''

The CIA and the U.S. Navy track people by quickly reading transcripts of logged phone calls, by looking at hospital records, by looking at authentic records of any kind for any person that they are monitoring or protecting. They do not have the money to actively and physically watch everyone at all times. They only have the money and the time to read the transcripts of the phone calls remotely. They will not usually get actively physically involved if it is drug cartel affiliated. Drug Cartels are smart. They know how to trick the CIA and the U.S. Navy about the whereabouts of the people that they are conspiring to kill and disappear. Especially if there are several different people using the same identity.. the real person cannot be found on documented record. Imagine if 1,000 people used the social security number and the name of a person that they are planning on killing.. by going to every hospital in town and in a greater city area.. for several days, months or even years.. Imagine if they all used a phony address, but with the real social security number and the real name of that person that they are planning on killing. If all 1,000 people put their X-Rays on the medical record.. the real person's body can never be identified if dead.. even if the real person's body is dissolved in acid. The real person can never be found on record ever again by anyone.. not even the CIA.

Killing someone and taking over their identity is actually a very simple and straightforward process. For instance: if the target real person looks enough like the doppelgänger that the doppelgänger is going to kill and if the target real person does not smile and show their teeth and show their ears in their identity card picture the doppelgänger can kill that real person and take over their identity because the cameras at that specific identity card database screening only take a picture of the front of the face and if the teeth of the real person are not legally identified on that specific record at that point-in-time then they cannot be legally identified on record. The doppelgänger could also cut off the nose of the target real person that looks like them so that the target real person cannot be legally identified where the target real person's face can never be matched to the picture on the target real person's identity card ever again, and then the doppelgänger can proceed to takeover the entire identity by simply taking the target real person's identity card and then use it all over town. IF: there is a dead body of the target real person and it shows up at the Coroners Office the face of the target real person's body cannot be matched to the picture on the target real person's identity card that was physically stolen by the doppelgänger. Every 7 years California scrubs all
biometric data from the Department of Motor Vehicles databases for every U.S. Citizen. Biometric data are things such as fingerprints and other biological information. The doppelgänger can then wait 7 years while using the target real person's identity card that they stole and then proceed to the Department of Motor Vehicles and get a identity card or driver license in the name of the target real person by using the target real person's birth certificate and social security card. The doppelgänger would probably get nose surgery and earplasty in order to look almost exactly like the target real person during the duration of the 7 years before the biometric information of the target real person is scrubbed off of the identity database information. IF: the doppelgänger has a greater force in gang numbers it is possible the target real person would be put into sodium hydroxide or level L-Lye also known as caustic soda in order to completely dissolve the target real person's body into complete bones. Usually gangs with strong numbers will hang around the area long enough to do the act of murder of the target real person and then keep the body until they can dissolve it with acid. No bridge or length of the bridge between the eyes of any person is ever the same width in centimeters. This is usually the only way to tell if the person is the same. However, as of the year 2015 it is known to the U.S. Federal Government that the width of the bridge between the eyes can be modified or temporarily modified.

'''What Is Legal Identification ?'''

Legal Identification are documents and records such as the dental X-Rays of a human person and identity cards. The U.S. Government does not walk around with hand-held X-Ray machines to scan a persons head in order to match the dental X-Rays on record to that specific person in order to verify that the person is the same person. The only way to get the teeth of a human person legally identified is to prove the shape of the front of the teeth and the inside of the mouth to the CIA and to the U.S. Navy by showing them a picture of the front of the teeth and a picture of the inside of the mouth the real person.

IF: the doppelgänger of the real person goes to get an identity card in the legal name of the target real person that looks like them by using the target real person's birth certificate and social security card the new identity card that is issued will have the same U.S. State Issued Identification Number as the target real person that looks like the doppelgänger and if that doppelgänger smiles in the photograph and shows their teeth in the picture that is then stored in the identity card database that person can then proceed to kill the target real person and take over their identity and begin living the identity on record anywhere because that doppelgänger showed their teeth and their ears in the picture on the identity card and the target real person did not.

This is possible because civilian identity databases such as Department of Motor Vehicle State Identity Card databases processes do not take a picture of the side of the head of the person, instead they only take a picture of the front of the face down to the neck. Therefore if there is a doppelgänger of the real person the doppelgänger of that real person could cut the target real person's nose off or cut their head off and mutilate it and then take over the target real persons' entire identity.

Now, the real person cannot legally claim to be the real person in the picture on the identity card because they did not show their teeth or their ears in the photograph and the doppelgänger did. Legal identity takeovers are usually more complicated than this and take several years. But, once this happens it is impossible to prove that it did happen. And why ? Because they do not take a picture of the side of the head and no one can legally prove the side of their head unless the identity database process took a picture of the side of the head of the real person and that database entry with the image was never modified. If anyone does it they will usually get nose surgeries and or ear surgeries to match the nose shape and the ear shape of the real person. This is not the same thing as plastic surgery. Plastic surgery involves putting plastic into the face, hence the phrase: Plastic Surgery. If anyone does get plastic surgery one can simply punch the face of the person who got plastic surgery and all of the plastic in the face will break and the face will be destroyed.

Proving something and legally proving something are completely different things. Once they do it, no one can ever legally prove it. Even if there are videos online of the real person showing the side of their head they still cannot legally prove the side of their head to the government.. because the government never took a picture of the side of the person's head when they took a picture of the real person.

It is also possible that N.C. law enforcement conspired to kill people in the Nazi Lowrider Car Club with a U.S. Marine doppelganger of the real son of the founders of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club as early as the year 2003 as they might be linked to a rival car club based in the U.S. State of Tennessee who deal drugs with the help of Southern U.S. African-American gang members. A bald headed N.C. man at approximately 6 foot 1 with blue eye color traveled to Bakersfield, California and got a RealID in the name and information of the son of the founders of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club in the years 2007 - 2008 and lived in the area of the Park Meadows Apartment Complex by Fabulous Burgers in Oildale, Kern County, Southern California around the year: 2013 and before while the real person was living around Peerless Avenue in Oildale, Kern County, Southern California. The U.S. Marine doppelgänger of the son of the founders of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club also did the same thing. It is highly likely that certain N.C. law enforcement spied on the 14 year old son of the founder of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club and his 15 year old girlfriend / cholita over the Internet in ~2001 as one of them traveled to Bakersfield, Kern County in Southern California and proceeded to the Department of Motor Vehicles and got an identity card in the real persons information by using his birth certificate and social security card in the year ~2008 and a few doppelgängers did the same thing to him before N.C. law enforcement did that, including a slight Doppelgänger of the real person who is a BPD Cop. This BPD Cop doppelgänger of the real person only looks like the real person from 1 angle of the side of the head at the jaw. This is a California State Felony. The fact that they did this proves they knew about the real person. The son of the founders of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club is not a Mexican and he is not in a Mexican Cartel or any cartel of any kind.

'''Known Doppelgängers of the son of the founders of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club where even if the male founder of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club is not the biological father of the son of the founder of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club the mother is biological and she is a founder:'''

* x1 Italian Using The Name Sullivan ( Who Is Shorter Than The Real Person )
* x3 Hispanic / Mexicans ( One Dark Skinned Mexican Who Wears a Silicone Mask To Look Like The Other 2 Mexicans and One Mexican Who Is Verified From Sinaloa, Mexico ( Who Are Shorter Than The Real Person ) )
* x1 BPD Cop Who Uses The Name Erin
* x1 U.S. Marine Who Uses The Name Sutton ( Who Is Shorter Than The Real Person )
* x1 Son of a Man Using The Name Steve In The Hell's Angels Motorcycle Club ( Who Is Shorter Than The Real Person )
* x1 Arab in Casablanca, Morocco ( Unknown )

'''Known Doppelgängers of the biological Mother:'''

* x1 ~5 foot tall Doppelgänger in Downtown Eugene, Oregon supposedly from Texarkana, Texas
* x1 Doppelgänger of an unknown shape and size from the U.S. State of Texas

'''Known People Using The Identity of The Biological Son of The Founders of The Nazi Lowrider Car Club'''

* x1 Bald BPD Cop Who Uses The Name Erin ( Who Used The Real Person's Identity While The Real Person Attended North High School In Oildale, Kern County, Southern California )
* x1 U.S. Marine From Tennessee, USA or East Coast, USA ( Who Is Shorter Than The Real Person, Who Uses The Name Sutton and Who Bleaches His Hair Ice Blonde )
* x1 Bald Cop With Small Blonde Patch of Hair On The Head From North Carolina ( Who Got a California ID card In The Real Person's Name In ~2008 and Who Also Uses The Name Aaron, ~6 Foot Tall )

IF: it is a law enforcement agent or a military person that looks like the real person and conspires to kill the real person and take over the real person's identity the only thing the law enforcement agent doppelgänger will know about the real person and the real person's family and their activities is anything that is on official records about the real people. They will only know what is "legally known" such as all of the information that is on record about the real person and the real person's family whether that information is true and accurate, mixed with truth and falsities or false information. They might also know other information such as from spying on the real person's electronics, phone call conversations and more. There are several techniques to defend against legal identity takeovers, but those will not be discussed in this article.

The doppelgängers of the Nazi Lowrider family have no relation to anyone in the real Nazi Lowrider Car Club at all whatsoever in any possible way, but it is possible and likely that the doppelgängers of the son of the founders of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club were drugging the Nazi Lowrider Car Club members for several years to decades because they became associated with the Sureños of Lamont, Kern County, Southern California. It is possible that several different bands of these drug gangs were drugging the Nazi Lowrider Car Club members for several years from the late 1990s to the mid to early 2000s.

'''How To Protect From Identity Takeovers'''

From personal experience the only way to protect the self and the family from identity takeovers from enemy and rival gangs is to keep the identity card current, maintain good family relationships and stick together. Create an account on every social media provider on the Internet with the same username.. such as an example: '''Elements''' so then it would be Elements@Twitter, Elements@Facebook, Elements@Instagram, etc. Have Archive.org archive the web pages of the social media accounts. Create an e-mail address on every free and public electronic mail server provider such as Google, Yahoo and more. Use a secure custom phone. Post videos and pictures of the body in 360 degrees. Create a PDF report to e-mail around town with pictures of IDs, social security card, birth certificate, pictures of yourself with friends, family, their phone numbers, your credit report, your emergency contacts, everywhere you lived and paid rent, pictures of your teeth in the front and inside of the mouth, pictures of your school and high school transcripts, immunizations, negative blood disease test results, every detail about yourself that is searchable by banks, credit companies or whatever. E-mail the PDF to the U.S. Government intelligence agencies and print the PDF report in full color. It usually takes about a year or longer to build one from scratch and once it reaches 100 pages it will cost around $100 cash to print it out in color and put it into a binder to also give to a friend or family member to keep for you. This makes it to where you can always be found by the government, friends and family and makes it harder for enemy gangs to crop themselves into your pictures to get legally associated with you to kill you. Everyone that looks at the fake will know that it is a cropped / photoshopped image with people in it that you do not know.

'''Phony Digital Intelligence Reports'''
* Nazi Lowriders have faced phony digital intelligence reports where threat actors have taken the law enforcement logos from the law enforcement websites and pasted the logos into Microsoft Office or into other digital word processing software where they then create phony reports about Nazi Lowriders and save the reports to the PDF file format and then begin to spread the disinformation around the Internet via social media messaging, electronic mail message and other methods. These are tricks meant to draw away support from the Nazi Lowrider Car Club.
* Authentic digital intelligence reports are not shared by the U.S. Federal government or by law enforcement agencies. Allied gangs of the Nazi Lowriders are known to have done this exact tactic to enemy N.C. law enforcement stalkers who traveled to [[Bakersfield]], [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] between the years of 2008 and 2013 and spied on Nazi Lowrider families and their children. Phony digital intelligence reports or technically any compiled information into any digital report can be created by anyone to say whatever they want about the target, whether that information is true and accurate, comical, completely false, truths mixed with falsities, or anything else. Information was spread to show Nazi Lowrider children that the N.C. law enforcement are disgusting, balding, non-hygienic, fat, child kidnappers, child molesters and more.
* The biological son of the founders of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club is known to have stated that he '''could feel the heat''' of the sun of [[Bakersfield]], [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] the entire time he endured these hardships.

'''Legal Entity Manipulation'''
* Legal entity manipulation is the direct manipulation of a legal entity by Law Enforcement, Military, Rival Gangs and Enemy Gangs. Legal entities are things like Car Clubs and Motorcycle Clubs that operate under a certain name and who declare who their members are. Legal entities can be manipulated by enemies if the enemies are smart enough to use the information of dead members of the Car Clubs and Motorcycle clubs in order to get legally associated with living members of those Car Clubs and Motorcycle clubs and kill them and their family members. This is actually known as a form of source manipulation. For instance: IF: one were to declare themself as a member of a gang, car club, or motorcycle club and then declare a family member as being related, but does not show a picture of that family member and their name then anyone who is not that family member can then pretend to be that family member to everyone else in order to get legally associated with that member in order to kill him / her. Even if that member shows a picture of that family member and declares their name to the public then anyone including Law Enforcement, Military, Rival Gangs and Enemy gangs can claim to be related to the family member of the gang member and they actually are not.. This enables them to kill the member and their family because everyone else thinks they are related when they are not. Legal Entity Manipulation is difficult to combat.

'''Phony Mobile Cell Phone Voice Conversations / Phony Mobile Cell Phone SMS Conversations'''
* Nazi Lowriders experience others around them who are trying to disappear them acting in the area on cell phones in order to trick the CIA / U.S. Navy who may be spying on all of the phone call conversations in the area. Enemy gangs usually send text messages and voice calls to members of their gangs in the area of a target in order to deliberately confuse the CIA / U.S. Navy into what is actually happening in that area of the target in order to disappear them or kill them. Another tactic is to spy on a target by hacking their cell phone to record the voice call conversations and then once enough voice call conversations are recorded and saved in .mp3 format to the commputer, they could kill that target and then take their cell phone and then make phone calls with that cell phone to other dead target cell phones that are under the physical control of other enemy gang members and play back the previously recorded voice call conversations into tricking the CIA / U.S. Navy that is actively spying on the mobile cell phones. Enemy gangs might also have the earlier versions of the Stingrays or IMSI catchers around town that 4g cell phones are vulnerable to.

'''Biological Warfare Food Safety Attacks In Kern County'''
* Nazi Lowriders fight enemy food safety tactics every day. Food safety tactics by enemies involve enemies ejaculating into the food at the grocery stores and creating foods that look the exact same as the real foods, but are instead made of ejaculation, saliva and other bodily fluids that are freeze dried.

'''U.S. Military Torture Tactics'''
* Nazi Lowriders, especially the biological son of the founders of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club have experienced U.S. Military Torture Tactics. These torture tactics include the drugging of a person to drive them insane while trafficking them around town and not allowing them to sleep or if they manage to fall asleep they walk by and make loud noises or tap on surfaces to deprive that person of any sleep. These tactics slowly drive a target insane.

'''Mental PsyOps / Psychological Operations'''
* Nazi Lowriders, especially the son of the founders of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club have experienced PsyOps / Psychological Operations where enemy gangs follow them around and drug them and then shout out or speak things around them in order to screw with their minds. Phrases stated recently are: "Fuck it you saw it kid, get gone.", "We can't get rid of him." and other phrases meant to screw with the minds of Nazi Lowriders that hear those phrases and other phrases. They also speak things in the area in order to trick anyone that spies remotely from cell phones and anyone else in the area that offer help to Nazi Lowriders or are there to help Nazi Lowriders.

'''Human Trafficking, Drugging and Confusion Tactics'''
* Nazi Lowriders, especially the biological son of the founders of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club have experienced drugging and confusion tactics by enemy groups. These tactics include being drugged by enemy groups and confused in attempts to traffick them to areas where they could kill them when no one is around. Nazi Lowriders are trained to defeat enemy human trafficking networks that drug people to control them by using mind control drugs such as [[Scopolomine]] Powder also known as [[Devil's Breath]].

'''Drug Cartel Drugging Tactics'''
* Drug Cartels whether Mexican or otherwise are known to drug their targets with different kinds of drugs in order to win. Fighting the drugging tactics by the enemy drug cartels is an every day task. Drugging tactics invlolve enemy drug cartels drugging the food and the drinks of their targets, walking up to their targets and sticking them with syringes filled with drugs in order to make the target pass out and placing drugged rags over their targets faces. Nazi Lowriders are known to have truces with several different drug cartels in Southern California.

'''Source Manipulation'''
* Nazi Lowriders, especially the biological son of the founders of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club experience '''Source Manipulation''' by enemy gangs, enemy cartels and enemy law enforcement. Source manipulation involves writing information down with cited sources or video recorded statements where the sources can be changed in the future in order to trick anyone looking at it when others are not. Source manipulation also involves doppelgängers of people such as family, friends, sexual partners, food items, property, money and more. Cropping of people into images to make it look like they know the person by showing people on the Internet and tricking an entire community into thinking they know that person so they can approach that person in real life to do them harm. Source manipulation also involves changing the sources that are shown to everyone else while the sources are still claimed by someone.. this could be things like Re-Posting a Facebook Post with a beautiful woman in the picture where the person that Re-Posted that Facebook Post has no control over the content and the media shown in that Facebook Post and when the enemies know that the person who Re-Posted that Facebook Post is not looking they can change the picture that is shown to something illegal and immoral such as CP and then go show everyone else so that person is then targeted by everyone.

'''Hacking Attacks'''
* Nazi Lowriders experience hacking attacks on a regular basis either from the U.S. Government and or enemy gangs. The biological son of the founders of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club has put together a complete set of defense tactics from the hacking attacks. In order to protect a mobile cell phone device from remote hacking and physical hacking the user must use a custom mobile Linux Operating System and a set of daily proceedures such as first flashing the mobile cell phone device baseband with the OEM baseband firmware directly from the manufacturer, encrypting and passwording the custom bootloader, encrypting and passwording the custom recovery firmware, securing and encrypting the actual operating system partition and then re-flashing the backup secure firmware ROMS every morning. This eliminates all possibilites of malware, remote access tools, viruses and more. The existing data is not touched and if the data such as the audio, documents, images, videos, text messages, call logs and other data is not already injected with malware the phone cannot be hacked remotely. Physically hacking the phone is harder to do for any enemy if it is secured in the unbreakable case with non-reversible titanium screws and if the SIM card is encrypted with a pincode it cannot be cloned. IF the proceedures are followed the mobile cell phone device is extremely difficult for any enemy that is physically in the area to hack / exploit. The custom laptops are ultra high quality and are made from customized rubberized IBM / Lenovo laptops that run the FreeBSD operating system. The biological son of the founders of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club recommended to the official FreeBSD Operating System development team to develop a mobile cell phone operating system based entirely on FreeBSD in 2018.

'''Indiscernibility Tactics'''
* Usually when the government covers things up like murders / deaths / political things and other things they take pieces of information from that and split it up all over the community, on the internet and in other places in order to cover it up. For instance: if there is a death that they are going to cover up and the person who is being covered up has a special kind of item like a ring with a custom shape.. the people that cover up the murder / death will put the shape that was on the ring onto different objects in the community as well as on the internet in order to split up the information so as to make it impossible for anyone else to figure it out. When the information about a human person is split up everywhere in the community it makes it impossible for them to be found from the Internet, by word-of-mouth on the street and by other means of finding people. When law enforcement, government and anyone else that knows how to kill people and cover it up they will usually find the records of the person that they have killed and slowly change the information on the records over time or they will delete / purge / remove all of the records so as to cover up the murder / death. When they do this there is absolutely no  legal proof that the person ever existed at all. Never alter / delete / purge records, ever.

'''Disease Blood Attacks, Disease Rape Drugging and Isolation'''
* Nazi Lowriders have experienced disease blood attacks where enemies take diseased blood from infected people and follow Nazi Lowriders around on foot in order to stick them with needles that have disease blood in it. They also experience drugging from enemy gangs where then the enemy gangs traffick them around town into areas where infected enemy gang members can rape them in order to deliberately give the Nazi Lowriders a disease. In response to these tactics they came up with a special mix of liquid to inject that kills every virus on contact. The mix includes diluted Sodium Hypochlorite at 7%.

'''Proof of Existence Tactics'''
* Nazi Lowriders struggle to prove that they exist on documented record as different enemy gangs as well as enemy corrupt law enforcement try to kill them. The way that these enemy tactics work is by confusing the government and the CIA / U.S. Navy and the family of the person about the whereabouts of the person. By altering / changing and destroying legal documentation such as birth certificates and other documentation and records in the community. For instance: if the government changed the birth certificate information about someone that they conspired to kill they would make that person all of their own family relationships on vital statistics in order to make it impossible for anyone to find them or their family on record. If a human person on vital statistics record is their own father, their own son, their own brother and sister and their spouse then if they are killed and if anyone investigates it including family it's impossible to know what happened or where they are at. They can never be found on linked records by investigating their whereabouts in the community. They would have no next-of-kin and by law the government is required to notify the next-of-kin in case of a disappearance or a death of a human person. The government doesn't draw attention to any deaths or disappearances and most people do not notice or take note of deaths and disappearances. If a human person does not have authentic records that are accurate or somewhat accurate such as authentic dental x-rays, biometric information, pictures of the real person in a database and other records like these, then the CIA / U.S. Navy cannot find them on record. If the CIA / U.S. Navy cannot find them on record and the enemies know that the CIA / U.S. Navy cannot find them on record anyone can kill them and there is absolutely no proof that they ever existed at all. Advanced gang members / cartel members / motorcycle gang members know these tactics and they will hang around the area of a target person to see if the CIA / U.S. Navy knows where the target person is at on record and if they don't know then the enemy gang can then kill them and get away with it. Valid and authentic identity cards with authentic pictures of the person are crucial in this scenario.

'''Radio Jamming'''
* Nazi Lowriders have experienced radio jamming where enemy gangs radio jam a small area in order to radio jam the cell phones to prevent phone calls.

===Nazi Lowriders Versus Cripps===
* Nazi Lowriders are known to have gone to war with the [[Crips]] of [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] and the [[Crips]] of [[Los Angeles County]], [[Southern California]] throughout the [[1980s]] and throughout the early to mid [[1990s]] where there were numerous responses to these incidents, combats and altercations covered by [[Los Angeles]], [[Los Angeles County]], [[Southern California]] video news stations and [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] news stations. The son of the founder of the '''Nazi Lowrider Car Club''' was taken away by law enforcement [[Officers]] of the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] as a baby in Downtown Los Angeles, Los Angeles County, Southern California in ~1988 after Cripps gang members fired several rounds into his father's lowrider vehicle in Downtown [[Los Angeles]], [[Los Angeles County]], [[Southern California]] while he was seated in the passenger seat of the lowrider vehicle. Gunfire was returned by the Nazi Lowriders and law enforcement and the local news station responded to the incident. The child was placed in [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] [[Child Protective Custody]].

* The biological son of the founders of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club failed a direct order to beat to death an African-American man on the border of Compton, Los Angeles County, Southern California and SouthGate, Los Angeles County, Southern California after having successfully stabbed several times a Plaza Boss of the Tijuana Mexican Drug Cartel on the border of San Diego, San Diego County, Southern California and Tijuana, Baja California, Northern Mexico.

The .22 caliber and .40 caliber bullet holes can still be seen in the building and the windows on the building as of the year: 2025.

* The biological son of the founders of the Nazi Lowriders was seen in a physical altercation with an African-American KC Cripp of Bakersfield on the CSUB campus in 2025.

===Nazi Lowriders Versus Unknown Enemy Gang On State Road===
* Nazi Lowriders were seen in gun battles with an enemy gang on State Road in Oildale, Southern California in ~1995 and another series of shootings in ~1996. Kern County Sheriff Department helicopters and the Bakersfield news stations helicopters responded to the incidents.

===Nazi Lowriders Versus Northern Sinaloa Cartel===
* Nazi Lowriders are known to have been in and have been seen in several shootouts with the [[Sinaloa Cartel]] in and around the city of [[South Gate]] in [[Los Angeles County]], [[Southern California]] throughout the [[1980s]] and the [[1990s]] over different disputes where news stations have responded to these incidents. There are several different families in what is collectively known as the Sinaloa Cartel. The Sinaloa Cartel is divided among the Northern California Sinaloa Cartel and the Southern California Sinaloa Cartel. The Northern California Sinaloa Cartel are known as Norteños and Norteñas and the Southern California Sinaloa Cartel are known as the Sureños and the Sureñas where there are several different divided families with unique alliances and enemies.

===Nazi Lowriders Versus Norteños===
* Nazi Lowriders were known to have battled [[Norteños]] in [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] where news stations have responded to these incidents. The altercations ended in several truces with the Norteño gangs. Several other truces were made between the Nazi Lowriders and different Norteños and Norteñas on the basis of a brief romantic sexual relationship between the pre-teen child son of the founder of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club and a female Norteña/Sureña who was much older than him before the initiation of the major Northern-California ~ Southern-California truces. California State Law determines that he was sexually molested by that female Hispanic Norteña because he was a child and she was in her late 20s. This female Hispanic Norteña was a bonafide member of the Sinaloa Cartel of Northern California in the years of the early 1990s and he witnessed her killing. This was the basis of one of his conversations with a high ranking boss of the [[Sinaloa Cartel]] in [[Southern California]] which established a truce with the Nazi Lowriders and put word out on the street in gangland that this killing was justified.

===Nazi Lowriders Versus Tijuana Mexican Cartel===
* Nazi Lowriders were allied with the [[Sureños]] of [[Lamont]], [[Kern County]] in [[Southern California]] when they battled the [[Tijuana Mexican Gangs]] in the late 1990s and they were later allied with the [[Hell's Angels]] of [[Oildale]], [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] and of [[Long Beach]], [[Los Angeles County]], [[Southern California]] when they battled the [[Tijuana Mexican Gangs]] in the early 2000s.

====Spark of The Wars Between The Nazi Lowriders and The Tijuana Mexican Cartel====
* The 11 year old son of the founders of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club was repeatedly drugged and sexually molested by a Non-Black [[Hispanic]] [[female]] gang member of the [[Crips]] of [[East Bakersfield]], [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] who also had membership in the [[Tijuana Mexican Cartel]] which is also known as the [[Tijuana Cartel]] and who might have targeted the Nazi Lowriders in ~1997. The name she used was Vida and Valveena. Condoms were used every time. It was unknown to the Nazi Lowrider family that she was a gang member of the female Hispanic [[Crips]] until after the incidents. She was known to shoot heroin drugs and she was afflicted with several different diseases. Her Ex-Spouse was a known member of a Tijuanian gang with connection to the Tijuana Mexican Cartel. Kern County authorities later proved that they exchanged phone calls talking about sex from his grandmother's landline house phone to her phone number and house in [[East Bakersfield]], [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] and she would take him to [[East Bakersfield]], [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] and sexually molested him. His grandmother caught her giving him oral sex in Central [[Oildale]], [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]]. The East Bakersfield Crips gang instantly declared a truce with the Nazi Lowriders over the sexual child molestation case after another member of the Nazi Lowriders Car Club spoke to her family in [[East Bakersfield]], [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]]. This Nazi Lowrider family later killed this female Hispanic Crip gang member in [[Oildale]], [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] and the killing was ruled as a justifiable homicide by the Kern County Sheriff Office of [[Oildale]], [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] and the Kern County Courts of [[Bakersfield]], [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]]. The victim of the sexual child molestation had deliberated on if he was going to put the female Hispanic Cripp gang member body into a large transparent container filled with pure bleach in order to permanently remove all pigmentation from her skin and so as to put her disinfected body on display. The child victim was forced to inject diluted bleach water intravenously after the incidents and he always received a negative test result for all sexually transmitted diseases. The fact that this Nazi Lowrider family killed this female Hispanic Crip gang member and the Kern County Sheriff Office and the Kern County Courts ruled this as a justifiable homicide proves without a reasonable doubt that the Crips / Cripps gang of [[East Bakersfield]], [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] have child molesters and pedophiles in their gang. This started a small war between the Nazi Lowriders and the Tijuana Cartel where that son was later ordered by senior membership of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club to stab a Tijuana Cartel [[Plaza Boss]] who lived on the border of [[San Diego]], [[San Diego County]], [[Southern California]] and [[Tijuana]], [[México]] and who facilitated drugs and humans across the border of [[México]] and into the [[United States]]. The Nazi Lowriders traveled to [[San Diego]], [[Southern California]] and confronted that [[Tijuana Mexican Cartel]] [[Plaza Boss]] and the child that was sexually molested stabbed that Tijuana Cartel Plaza Boss in the side. Law Enforcement later confirmed the stabbing. This small war between the Nazi Lowriders and the Tijuana Cartel ended in a truce in ~2002. The son of the founders of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club was taken away from his family and placed in Child Protective Custody after his mother was seen in a shootout in [[Oildale]], [[California]] in ~1997. The local Bakersfield television news stations responded to the incident.
* The son of the founders of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club later had a non-violent altercation with the Tijuana Cartel around [[San Diego]], [[Southern California]] and [[Orange County]], [[Southern California]] in 2022.
* It is possible that scenes from the Hollywood Film The Cell was partly based on these real life incidents because according to gangland politics in Southern California all allied gangs are required to know about sexual child molestation incidents within gang families and all allied gangs of the Nazi Lowriders were notified, including the Italian Mafias of [[West Los Angeles]], [[Los Angeles County]], [[Southern California]] and as shown in the scenes of the Hollywood Film [[The Cell]], a serial killer character named Carl Stargher played by Vincent D'Onofrio kills a woman and soaks her body in pure bleach in [[East Bakersfield]], [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] and fantasizes about killing people with a woman named Catherine Deane who is played by the actress Jennifer Lopez. The victim of this child sexual molestation had told the allied gang families that he wanted to put her body into a transparent container filled with bleach.
* Gangland politics also allow for the victim of this sexual child molestation case to say whatever he wants about his sexual child molestors on the Internet and in person.
* Before having been kidnapped by the U.S. Navy he spoke to a high ranking boss of the Hell's Angels of [[Long Beach]], [[Los Angeles County]], [[Southern California]] who offered to recruit him into the Hell's Angels Motorcycle Club. He stated that he declined membership, but he would assist them with software development. This was after the truces that were made between the Vagos Motorcycle Club and the Hell's Angels Motorcycle Club bands in different places in Southern California.

===Nazi Lowriders Versus Northern Pacific Italian Mafia===
* Nazi Lowriders are known to have had bouts with the Italian Mafia of the Northern Pacific Region stretching from Northern-California to Central-Oregon. Two Nazi Lowriders were seen chasing after Italian Mafia members on the Amtrak Train from Bakersfield, Southern California to Central-Oregon in 2017 and one of the Nazi Lowriders were hospitalized in Seattle, Washington in 2017. The incident was captured on video at the stores around Downtown [[Fresno]], [[Southern California]] and several days later in Downtown [[Seattle]], [[Washington]].

===Nazi Lowriders Versus U.S. Marines===
* In 2005 the [[U.S. Marines]] attempted a covert infiltration of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club and the Nazi Lowrider Prison Gang by using the identity of the son of one of the founders of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club while they repeatedly drugged him around [[Oildale]], [[Southern California]].

* The U.S. Marines are seen in several videos calling on the Nazi Lowriders in East Los Angles, Southern California and in the other recorded media the U.S. Marines are defeated by the Nazi Lowriders and the Sinaloa Cartel in East Los Angeles, Southern California.

* In several videos that were recorded by the rogue U.S. Marines and uploaded to the Internet show several U.S. Marines masterbating in public parks in and around Bakersfield, Southern California from ~2008 ? Where the rogue U.S. Marines then sent the video links to the Kern County Sheriff Office Online Reporting System. The rogue U.S. Marines were using the names of several dead Nazi Lowriders when they made the fraudulent reports online. The altercations with the U.S. Marines and their attempted infiltrations of this car club dealt a crippling blow to the Nazi Lowrider Car Club by the year of 2015.

===Nazi Lowriders Versus Texas Gangs and North Carolina Gangs In Northern Oildale===
* In ~2008 the Nazi Lowriders are seen in a series of videos that show them fighting Non-Hispanic White Texas gang members and Non-Hispanic White North Carolina gang members who kept claiming to be members of the Hell's Angels/Aryan Brotherhood and were not. The videos show the Nazi Lowriders knocking on the door of the apartment lived in by one of the opponents where they walk into the apartment and proceed to anally rape that opponent. Another video shows the local '''Hell's Angels''' chapter of Oildale jacking off into a 1 gallon jug where they then proceed into the apartment and force that opponent to drink the 1 gallon of ejaculation. The opponents moved away and returned with more of their families in 2013 and they released videos of themselves having anal sex with each other in order to confuse the querying of the original videos to make it look like they were in the '''Hell's Angels''' if anyone looked it up. They're not. They moved out of the apartments again in 2013 and moved back into the apartments in 2020. The entire area by North High School in Oildale, Southern California is now under invasion by these gangs. In 2005 a Non-Hispanic White and balding individual with blue eye color and 3 U.S. Marines threatned to kill the son of the founder of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club by cutting off his nose and head so he could not legally prove he was the "guy in the picture" on his California I.D. card. The balding Non-Hispanic White individual proceeded and stole his California I.D. card. They may have been spying on this Nazi Lowrider family from the Internet starting from the years of 2001 or 2003.

* The relative of the son of the founder of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club was also seen in the original video recorded in the area in ~2007 - ~2008 where that member is wearing Vagos Motorcycle Club jacket addressing the son of the founder of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club telling him not to go to the shown area in the video after 2016 or he would be drugged by the enemies, confused and forced to wander because they planned on moving back into the apartments there after having rehearsed 2 times what they were planning to do to targets in the area.

* These incidents were tied to the attempted infiltration of the U.S. Marines and other gangs into the Nazi Lowrider Car Club from ~2006 and onward. The incidents also involve an Irish-American girl completely unaffiliated with the Nazi Lowriders who is probably related to a U.S. Marine. The girl was shun away by the 20 and half year old son of the founder of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club in 2007 after returning home to Bakersfield, Kern County, Southern California and who was previously illegally drugged by the U.S. Marines / U.S. Navy. The biological son of the founder of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club attempted to court the Irish-American girl, but the U.S. Marine doppelgänger who followed him home found out where he lived and took the girl.

===Nazi Lowriders Versus Hackers and Invading Forces In Bakersfield===
* The founders of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club recorded videos for their son from the years of ~2007 to ~2010 where the videos show their son and other Nazi Lowrider families how to build a lowrider from scratch and how to run the syndicate. Showing love for their son. The videos were found online by hackers and enemy gangs where they cut up all of the original videos and used DeepFakes, FaceApp and other software to try and crop themseleves into the videos while network blocking the son from seeing the altered versions of the videos. If one closely studies the videos they will see that they even employed doppelgängers and cut up the videos to try and make it look like the'yre in the videos or that are addressed at them or at the enemy gang members, they're not. Their son is fully recognized all throughout Southern California and does not have any Italian or Irish ancestry or any ancestry from Texas. Their son is partially Hispanic, American Indian and Non-Hispanic White, but then again so is every person with ancestry from Mexico and the areas now known as California State. Almost every person with ancestry from the areas now known as Mexico and the areas known as California State are partially Hispanic ( ancestry from Spain ), partially Mesitzo / American Indian ( ancestry from Indigenous America ).

===Nazi Lowriders Versus Hackers===
* Nazi Lowriders are known to have engaged in a digital war with hackers where they drew out several hackers in the real world from 2009 - 2013 and later. Several collections of videos show the Nazi Lowriders engaging in digital wars with computer hackers where these hackers were drawn out, found and defeated in Southern California.

=Kidnappings of Nazi Lowrider Members and Nazi Lowrider Family Members=

===Cases of Kidnappings of The Son of The Founder of The Nazi Lowriders===
* In ~1998 it was known and observed by the [[U.S. Navy]] that the 11 year old son of the founder of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club spent several days talking privately with one of the highest ranking bosses of the [[Sinaloa Cartel]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[Los Angeles County]], [[Southern California]] about the future politics of [[California]] and the future of [[Southern California]]. This son claimed to have been kidnapped and drugged by the [[U.S. Navy]] [[SeaBees]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[Los Angeles County]], [[Southern California]] after another visit with this Sinaloa Cartel Boss. He has stated that he was kidnapped in plain site outside of [[South Gate]], [[Los Angeles County]], [[Southern California]] by [[South Compton]], [[Los Angeles County]], [[Southern California]] with phony records by a blonde woman from the [[U.S. Navy]] [[Seabees]] after they found out about his interactions with the [[Sinaloa Cartel]] Boss. The [[U.S. Navy]] [[SeaBees]] woman asked him about his interaction with the Sinaloa Cartel Boss. He was placed on several California State probations and Kern County, Southern California probations as a minor child and as a minor child his legal name was forcibly changed and concealed in [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]]. The [[Kern County]] Juvenile Court Records belonging to the son of the founder of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club were sealed and the Kern County Juvenile Courts declared him mentally incompetent, mentally disabled and mentally ill after having stabbed a [[Tijuana Cartel]] [[Plaza Boss]] in [[San Diego]], [[San Diego County]], [[Southern California]].

* In 2012 it is possible that the son of the founder of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club was kidnapped and drugged for several weeks in an apartment in East Bakersfield in a local conspiracy in order to find out information. It was observed that several women went in and out of the apartment and several BPD officers went in and out of the apartment.

===Criminal Activities===

====Coupon Fraud====
* From 2008 To 2012 The Nazi Lowriders obtained the software needed to create digital and physical coupons complete with bar codes that scan at the stores. The son of the founders of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club and his friends received over $20,000 United States Dollars by getting completely free pre-paid American Express Gift Cards by using coupons at nearly every Rite-Aid in Southern California and at nearly every Walgreens in Southern California. They also purchased over $300 United States Dollars worth of groceries at each visit at hundreds of different stores in Southern Calfornia and they received the food items almost completely for free by using the coupons. Technically this is a legal grey area and the coupons are not illegal.

===Notable Crimes===

=In Popular Culture=
Nazi Lowriders are well known in popular culture in Southern California. The founders of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club and their biological son have been approached for media coverage in different vehicle media and computer related media organizations namely [[Cyberpunk|Cyberpunks]] for his computer programming ventures as a teenager and Lowrider Magazines of Southern California for the ultra custom and all mechanical Lowriders engineered by the Nazi Lowriders. It is known that the Nazi Lowriders have been offered media coverage by Hollywood, Southern California media organizations connected to film actors such as [[Edward Furlong]] and [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], but mostly have declined. The founders of the Nazi Lowriders have stated that they do not like media coverage.

===In Hollywood, Southern California Film===
* In the 2010 crime film ''[[Shot Caller (film)|Shot Caller]]'', Jacob "Money" Harlon briefly has a cellmate named Ripper (played by [[Keith Jardine]]) who is a member of the Nazi Lowriders Prison Gang, sporting an "NLR" tattoo across his forehead.

=Sources and Citations=
There are several inauthentic sources about the Nazi Lowriders that are available on the Internet that are used to cite statements here and elsewhere. The Nazi Lowriders did not start as a Neo-Nazi Gang or a Neo-Nazi Prison Gang and the Nazi Lowriders have never operated outside of [[Southern California]] and they do not operate outside of [[Southern California]]. Literally stated: The Nazi Lowriders do not operate in any U.S. State or in any U.S. Territory exept for the U.S. State of California. Some fraudulent and phony sources here claim that the Nazi Lowriders operate in the U.S. State of Texas, they don't. Another phony source claims that the Nazi Lowriders operate in the U.S. State of Florida, they don't.

===Inauthentic / Fraudlent Internet Sources On Nazi Lowriders===
''''Why Are These Online / Digital Sources On Nazi Lowriders Phony and Ficticious ?''''

These people are trying desperately to get legally associated with the real Nazi Lowriders by creating fictitious associations on the Internet. Nazi Lowriders were founded in Kern County, Southern California
and in Los Angeles County, Southern California and not anywhere else. Nazi Lowriders require specific criteria for membership. A person had to have been living in Southern California in the 1970s, the 1980s and the 1990s and had to have been committing crimes with the validated and recognized Nazi Lowriders by the Kern County Sheriff Office, the Los Angeles County Sheriff Office and the Los Angeles Police Department who physically worked in these law enforcement agencies within the 1970s, the 1980s and the 1990s to be a member of the Nazi Lowriders today. People from Texas are not allowed membership in the Nazi Lowriders. All of the listed sources below this paragraph are completely fictitious and phony sources about Nazi Lowriders.
